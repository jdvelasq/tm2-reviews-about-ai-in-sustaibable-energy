   INVERSE_DESIGN of high performance interfaces and interphases like the sei,
   remains an ELUSIVE_DREAM. here, we present a perspective and
   POSSIBLE_BLUEPRINT for a FUTURE_BATTERY_RESEARCH_STRATEGY to reach this
   AMBITIOUS_GOAL. semi supervised GENERATIVE_DEEP_LEARNING models trained on
   all sources of AVAILABLE_DATA, i.e., extensive multi fidelity datasets from
   multi scale computer simulations and databases, OPERANDO_CHARACTERIZATION
   from LARGE_SCALE_RESEARCH facilities, HIGH_THROUGHPUT_SYNTHESIS and
   laboratory testing, need to work closely together to unlock this dream.  we
   show how understanding and tracking DIFFERENT_TYPES of uncertainties in the
   experimental and SIMULATION_METHODS, as well as the
   MACHINE_LEARNING_FRAMEWORK for the GENERATIVE_MODEL, is crucial for
   controlling and improving the fidelity in the PREDICTIVE_DESIGN of
   BATTERY_INTERFACES and interphases.  we argue that SIMULTANEOUS_UTILIZATION
   of data from MULTIPLE_DOMAINS, including data from failed experiments, will
   play a CRITICAL_ROLE in accelerating the development of

   ELUSIVE_IDEA, and therefore, this REVIEW_SUMMARIZES_WORKS by VARIOUS_GROUPS,
   the milestones they have achieved, and the roadmap to be taken on the study
   of HYDROGEN_STORAGE using low cost magnesium composites.  mg based compounds
   are further examined from the perspective of
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_STUDIES, which helps to improve prediction of their
   properties and HYDROGEN_STORAGE_PERFORMANCE. there exist several techniques
   to improve the performance of mg based compounds:
   MICROSTRUCTURE_MODIFICATION, use of CATALYTIC_ADDITIVES, and
   COMPOSITION_REGULATION. MICROSTRUCTURE_MODIFICATION is usually achieved by
   employing DIFFERENT_SYNTHETIC_TECHNIQUES like SEVERE_PLASTIC_DEFORMATION,
   HIGH_ENERGY_BALL milling, and cold rolling, among others.  these
   SYNTHETIC_APPROACHES are discussed herein.  in this review, a discussion of
   KEY_PARAMETERS and operating conditions are highlighted in a view to finding
   HIGH_STORAGE_CAPACITY and faster kinetics.  furthermore, RECENT_APPROACHES
   like MACHINE_LEARNING have found application in guiding the

AB to deal with the relatively low her CATALYSIS_EFFICIENCIES of existing
   COBALT_NITRIDE (con) catalysts, it is highly desirable to design NEW_TYPES
   of CON_CATALYSTS to realize high efficiency water splitting.  herein, by
   using simple hydrothermal and NITRIDATION_METHODS, we realize the synthesis
   of novel three dimensional (3d) flower like con (con f), CON_POROUS_SPHERES
   (con s), and polyhedral con (con p)viautilizing VARIOUS_WEAK_BASES.
   benefiting from a much larger surface area and a unique 3d flower like
   architecture (consisting of 2d porous CON_NANOSHEETS), the con f catalyst
   shows highly exposed ACTIVE_SITES and superior mass/electron transfer
   abilities.  naturally, the con f catalyst exhibits more
   OUTSTANDING_HYDROGEN_EVOLUTION_REACTION (her) and OXYGEN_EVOLUTION_REACTION
   (oer) CATALYTIC_PERFORMANCE than either con p or con s.  in order to achieve
   a CURRENT_DENSITY of 10 ma cm2, 3d flower like con f needs
   ONLY_LOW_OVERPOTENTIALS of 191.7 mv and 276.2 mv for the her and oer,
   respectively.  furthermore, upon using the 3d flower like con f catalyst as
   both the anode and CATHODE_MATERIAL in a two ELECTRODE overall water
   splitting cell, the corresponding ()con fcon f(+) cell achieves a
   CURRENT_DENSITY of 10 ma cm2at 1.613 v in 1.0 M_KOH, which is just 10 mv
   larger than a ()pt/cruo2(+) cell (1.592 v). it outperforms most existing non
   precious metal ELECTROCATALYSTS, demonstrating superior water splitting
   efficiency.  in addition, the 3d flower like con f catalyst shows
   EXCELLENT_STABILITY during the alkaline her and oer, and FULL_WATER
   splitting.  this work successfully opens a NEW_PATHWAY for boosting the
   her/oer electrocatalytic abilities of CON_CATALYSTS through structural

AB QUANTUM_DOT_SENSITIZED_SOLAR_CELLS (qdsscs) have become important in dealing
   with the energy economy environment dilemma of today's world.  qdsscs offer
   a UNIQUE_SET of characteristics including MULTIPLE_EXCITON_GENERATION and
   higher EXTINCTION_COEFFICIENTS associated with QUANTUM_DOTS (qds), avowing
   its potential for HIGH_PHOTOCONVERSION_EFFICIENCY (pce), which is evident
   from its augmented increase of the pce to  15 % within the PAST_DECADE. to
   make FULL_USE of the PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL_COMPETENCE of qdsscs, researchers
   have strategically dealt with VARIOUS_DETRIMENTAL_EVENTS taking place within
   qds and on INTERFACIAL_POSITIONS in photoanodes.  BACK_TRANSFER of
   photogenerated electrons, electron/hole RECOMBINATION via SURFACE_DEFECTS,
   and photocorrosion of qds seriously deteriorate the performance of qdsscs
   and are thus considered a bottleneck for their further improvements.
   DEPOSITION of INTERFACIAL_LAYERS (ils) has proven beneficial in this regard
   and hence, it requires a COMPREHENSIVE_OVERVIEW. based on their positions
   inside the photoanode of qdsscs, ils offer single or MULTIPLE_ROLES in
   improving the pce: improvement of SURFACE_PASSIVATION (PASSIVATION_ILS),
   DEPOSITION of qds (seeding ils), and/or control of the BACK_TRANSFER of
   electrons to the electrolyte (blocking ils). this review covers the
   MULTIFUNCTIONAL_DIVERSITY of ils inside qdsscs,
   APPOSITE_CHARACTERIZATION_TECHNIQUES for ils, and prospects regarding their
   role.  2022 the KOREAN_SOCIETY of industrial and ENGINEERING_CHEMISTRY

AB HYDROGEN_SPILLOVER, a COMMON_ACTIVE_SPECIES_MIGRATION_PHENOMENON, has drawn
   TREMENDOUS_ATTENTION in the past few years.  the spilled ATOMIC_HYDROGEN can
   not only participate in CATALYTIC_REACTIONS as reactants, but also induce
   the support to form defects or PHASE_TRANSITIONS, thus adjusting the
   ENERGY_BAND and improving CATALYTIC_PERFORMANCE. as a result,
   HYDROGEN_SPILLOVER has BROAD_APPLICATION_POTENTIAL in
   HETEROGENEOUS_CATALYSIS and HYDROGEN_PRODUCTION. however, a CLEAR_SUMMARY of
   REACTION_MECHANISM and IMPORTANT_APPLICATIONS of HYDROGEN_SPILLOVER is still

   HYDROGEN_SPILLOVER. first, DIFFERENT_TYPES of HYDROGEN_SPILLOVER is
   comprehensively expounded.  second, several SIGNIFICANT_STRUCTURAL_MODELS of
   HYDROGEN_SPILLOVER are briefly introduced.  then the TYPICAL_APPLICATIONS of
   HYDROGEN_SPILLOVER_PHENOMENON are clearly summarized, including
   CATALYTIC_HYDROGEN_PRODUCTION, CARBON_DIOXIDE_HYDROGENATION, HYDROGENATION
   of ORGANIC_COMPOUNDS and HYDROGEN_STORAGE. in the end, we summarize the

AB powered by clean and RENEWABLE_ENERGY, ELECTROCATALYTIC
   CO2_REDUCTION_REACTION (co2rr) to CHEMICAL_FEEDSTOCKS is an EFFECTIVE_WAY to
   mitigate the GREENHOUSE_EFFECT and artificially close the CARBON_CYCLE.
   however, the performance of ELECTROCATALYTIC co2rr was impeded by the
   STRONG_THERMODYNAMIC_STABILITY of co2 molecules and the HIGH_SUSCEPTIBILITY
   to HYDROGEN_EVOLUTION_REACTION (her) in AQUEOUS_PHASE_SYSTEMS. moreover, the
   NUMEROUS_REACTION_INTERMEDIATES formed at very near POTENTIALS_LEAD to
   POOR_SELECTIVITY of REACTION_PRODUCTS, further preventing the
   industrialization of co2rr.  CATALYSIS in confined space can enrich the
   REACTION_INTERMEDIATES to improve their coverage at the ACTIVE_SITE,
   INCREASE_LOCAL_PH to inhibit her, and accelerate the MASS_TRANSFER rate of
   reactants/products and subsequently facilitate co2rr performance.
   therefore, we summarize the RESEARCH_PROGRESS on the application of the
   CONFINEMENT_EFFECTS in the direction of co2rr in theoretical and
   EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECTIONS. we first analyzed the mechanism of the
   CONFINEMENT_EFFECT. subsequently, the CONFINEMENT_EFFECT was discussed in
   VARIOUS_FORMS, which can be characterized as an
   ABNORMAL_CATALYTIC_PHENOMENON due to the RELATIVE_LIMITATION of the
   REACTION_REGION. in specific, based on the PHYSICAL_STRUCTURE of the
   catalyst, the CONFINEMENT_EFFECT was divided in four categories:
   PORE_STRUCTURE_CONFINEMENT, CAVITY_STRUCTURE_CONFINEMENT,
   ACTIVE_CENTER_CONFINEMENT, and other CONFINEMENT_METHODS. based on these
   discussions, we also have summarized the prospects and challenges in this
   field.  this REVIEW_AIMS to stimulate greater interests for the development
   of more efficient confined strategy for co2rr in the future.  2022 wiley vch

AB the INITIAL_COULOMBIC_EFFICIENCY (ICE) of ELECTRODE_MATERIALS is closely
   related to the ENERGY_DENSITY of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES (libs). however, some
   PROMISING_ELECTRODE_MATERIALS for next GENERATION_LIBS_SUFFER from LOW_ICE,
   which inevitably hinders their PRACTICAL_APPLICATION. among the discovered
   modified strategies for libs, ELECTROLYTE_OPTIMIZATION has attracted
   EXTENSIVE_ATTENTION due to its FACILE_OPERATION_PROCESS. herein, the role of
   ICE in libs is first analyzed.  subsequently, the RECENT_PROGRESS on
   EFFECTIVE_ELECTROLYTE_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGIES for boosting ICE in lib is
   summarized (including the optimization of LITHIUM_SALT, SALT_CONCENTRATION,
   solvent, and ELECTROLYTE_ADDITIVE). finally, FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS of
   ELECTROLYTE_OPTIMIZATION for boosting ICE are proposed.  this review
   provides VALUABLE_GUIDANCE for developing advanced electrolyte for libs.
