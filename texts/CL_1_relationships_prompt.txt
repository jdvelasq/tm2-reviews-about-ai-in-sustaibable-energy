Title: ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS_APPLICATIONS: a \
review
Abstract:
```
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS are widely accepted as a TECHNOLOGY_OFFERING \
an ALTERNATIVE_WAY to tackle complex and ill defined problems. they can \
learn from examples, are FAULT_TOLERANT in the sense that they are able \
to handle noisy and INCOMPLETE_DATA, are able to deal with non linear \
problems and, once trained, can perform prediction and generalisation at \
HIGH_SPEED. they have been used in DIVERSE_APPLICATIONS in control, \
robotics, PATTERN_RECOGNITION, forecasting, medicine, POWER_SYSTEMS, \
manufacturing, optimisation, SIGNAL_PROCESSING and social/psychological \
sciences. they are particularly useful in system modelling such as in \
implementing COMPLEX_MAPPINGS and SYSTEM_IDENTIFICATION. this paper \
presents VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS of NEURAL_NETWORKS mainly in \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PROBLEMS in a thematic rather than a chronological or \
any other order. ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS have been used by the author \
in the field of SOLAR_ENERGY; for modelling and design of a SOLAR_STEAM \
generating plant, for the estimation of a \
PARABOLIC_TROUGH_COLLECTOR_INTERCEPT_FACTOR and LOCAL_CONCENTRATION_RATIO \
and for the modelling and PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION of SOLAR_WATER heating \
systems. they have also been used for the estimation of HEATING_LOADS of \
buildings, for the prediction of AIR_FLOW in a naturally ventilated \
TEST_ROOM and for the prediction of the ENERGY_CONSUMPTION of a \
PASSIVE_SOLAR_BUILDING. in all those models a multiple hidden \
LAYER_ARCHITECTURE has been used. errors reported in these models are \
well within ACCEPTABLE_LIMITS, which clearly suggest that \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS can be used for modelling in other fields of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION and use. the work of other researchers in the \
field of RENEWABLE_ENERGY and other ENERGY_SYSTEMS is also reported. this \
includes the use of ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS in SOLAR_RADIATION and \
wind SPEED_PREDICTION, PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, BUILDING_SERVICES_SYSTEMS \
and load forecasting and prediction.  2001 ELSEVIER_SCIENCE_LTD.

Title: REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING for DEMAND_RESPONSE: a review of algorithms and \
MODELING techniques
Abstract:
```
buildings account for about 40% of the GLOBAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION. \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES are one possibility to mitigate the dependence \
of RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS on the ELECTRICAL_GRID. however, their \
integration into the existing GRID_INFRASTRUCTURE must be done carefully \
to avoid instability, and guarantee availability and security of supply. \
DEMAND_RESPONSE, or demand side management, IMPROVES_GRID_STABILITY by \
increasing DEMAND_FLEXIBILITY, and SHIFTS_PEAK_DEMAND towards periods of \
peak RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION by providing consumers with \
ECONOMIC_INCENTIVES. this PAPER_REVIEWS the use of \
REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING, a MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHM, for \
DEMAND_RESPONSE_APPLICATIONS in the SMART_GRID. REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING \
has been utilized to control DIVERSE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS such as \
ELECTRIC_VEHICLES, HEATING_VENTILATION_AND_AIR_CONDITIONING (hvac) \
systems, SMART_APPLIANCES, or batteries. the future of DEMAND_RESPONSE \
greatly depends on its ability to prevent CONSUMER_DISCOMFORT and \
integrate HUMAN_FEEDBACK into the CONTROL_LOOP. REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING is \
a potentially model free ALGORITHM that can adapt to its environment, as \
well as to HUMAN_PREFERENCES by directly integrating USER_FEEDBACK into \
its CONTROL_LOGIC. our REVIEW_SHOWS that, although many papers consider \
HUMAN_COMFORT and satisfaction, most of them focus on single agent \
systems with demand independent ELECTRICITY_PRICES and a \
STATIONARY_ENVIRONMENT. however, when ELECTRICITY_PRICES are modelled as \
demand dependent variables, there is a risk of shifting the PEAK_DEMAND \
rather than shaving it. we identify a need to further \
EXPLORE_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to coordinate MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS that can \
participate in DEMAND_RESPONSE_PROGRAMS under demand dependent \
ELECTRICITY_PRICES. finally, we discuss directions for FUTURE_RESEARCH, \
e.g., quantifying how rl could adapt to changing URBAN_CONDITIONS such as \
BUILDING_REFURBISHMENT and urban or POPULATION_GROWTH.  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD

Smart grids, representing a novel paradigm in the electric power transmission network, aim to enhance energy efficiency and utilization by leveraging advanced energy management techniques [62]. One of the core goals of smart grids is efficient energy management which, when harmonized with the potential of emerging technologies like reinforcement learning, can contribute significantly to improving grid stability [53]. Reinforcement learning has proven effective in managing diverse energy systems within the smart grid, such as electric vehicles and smart appliances, by adapting to environmental changes and integrating feedback mechanisms for more tailored energy utilization [53]. Furthermore, energy management systems can be optimized using sophisticated algorithms, with the idea of microgrids acting as a subset of the larger smart grid infrastructure, ensuring localized and more efficient energy distribution and consumption [6, 62].

Smart grids are an evolutionary shift in the electric power transmission networks. Their primary purpose is to elevate energy efficiency and optimize energy utilization [62]. One of the foundational goals of smart grids is effective energy management. With the digital transformation of traditional energy systems [94], there's an immense opportunity to harness data and insights to make these grids even smarter. Utilizing advanced techniques like reinforcement learning becomes a game-changer in this respect. Reinforcement learning has demonstrated efficacy in managing a variety of energy systems embedded within the smart grid, such as electric vehicles and smart appliances. This technology ensures adaptability to environmental dynamics and embeds feedback mechanisms for a customized energy consumption approach [53].

Additionally, with the rising influence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the energy sector [41], the optimization of energy management systems has become more sophisticated. As a manifestation of this optimization, microgrids emerge as a specialized subset of the overarching smart grid infrastructure. They ensure localized energy distribution, promoting more efficient consumption patterns [6, 62].

collection, storage and analysis with the help of WIDE_INSTALLATION of \
SMART_METERS and sensors. this paper introduces the big data analytics \
and corresponding applications in smart grids. the characterizations of \
big data, smart grids as well as huge amount of data collection are \
firstly discussed as a prelude to illustrating the motivation and \
potential advantages of implementing advanced data analytics in smart \
grids. basic concepts and the procedures of the TYPICAL_DATA_ANALYTICS \
for general problems are also discussed. the advanced applications of \
different data analytics in smart grids are addressed as the main part of \
this paper. by dealing with huge amount of data from electricity network, \
meteorological information system, geographical information system etc., \
many benefits can be brought to the existing power system and improve the \
customer service as well as the SOCIAL_WELFARE in the era of big data. \
however, to advance the applications of the big data analytics in real \

Title: a survey on DEEP_LEARNING_METHODS for POWER_LOAD and RENEWABLE_ENERGY \
FORECASTING in SMART_MICROGRIDS
Abstract:
```
microgrids have recently emerged as a building block for SMART_GRIDS \
combining distributed RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (ress), \
ENERGY_STORAGE_DEVICES, and LOAD_MANAGEMENT_METHODOLOGIES. the \
INTERMITTENT_NATURE of ress brings several challenges to the \
SMART_MICROGRIDS, such as reliability, POWER_QUALITY, and balance between \
supply and demand. thus, FORECASTING POWER_GENERATION from ress, such as \
WIND_TURBINES and SOLAR_PANELS, is becoming essential for the efficient \
and PERPETUAL_OPERATIONS of the POWER_GRID and it also helps in attaining \
OPTIMAL_UTILIZATION of ress. ENERGY_DEMAND FORECASTING is also an \
INTEGRAL_PART of SMART_MICROGRIDS that helps in planning the \
POWER_GENERATION and energy trading with COMMERCIAL_GRID. \
MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) and DEEP_LEARNING (dl) based models are \
PROMISING_SOLUTIONS for predicting CONSUMERS_DEMANDS and \
ENERGY_GENERATIONS from ress. in this context, this manuscript provides a \
COMPREHENSIVE_SURVEY of the existing dl based approaches, which are \
developed for power FORECASTING of WIND_TURBINES and SOLAR_PANELS as well \
as ELECTRIC_POWER_LOAD FORECASTING. it also discusses the datasets used \
to train and test the different dl based PREDICTION_MODELS, enabling \
FUTURE_RESEARCHERS to identify APPROPRIATE_DATASETS to use in their work. \
even though there are a few related SURVEYS regarding ENERGY_MANAGEMENT \
in SMART_GRID_APPLICATIONS, they are focused on a \
SPECIFIC_PRODUCTION_APPLICATION such as either solar or wind. moreover, \
none of the SURVEYS_REVIEW the FORECASTING schemes for production and \
LOAD_SIDE simultaneously. finally, PREVIOUS_SURVEYS do not consider the \
datasets used for FORECASTING despite their significance in dl based \
FORECASTING approaches. hence, our SURVEY_WORK is intrinsically different \
due to its data centered view, along with presenting dl based \
applications for load and ENERGY_GENERATION FORECASTING in both \
residential and COMMERCIAL_SECTORS. the comparison of \
DIFFERENT_DL_APPROACHES discussed in this MANUSCRIPT_REVEALS that the \
efficiency of such FORECASTING methods is highly dependent on the amount \
of the HISTORICAL_DATA and thus a LARGE_NUMBER of DATA_STORAGE_DEVICES \
and HIGH_PROCESSING_POWER_DEVICES are required to deal with BIG_DATA. \
finally, this STUDY_RAISES several OPEN_RESEARCH_PROBLEMS and \
opportunities in the area of RENEWABLE_ENERGY FORECASTING for \
SMART_MICROGRIDS.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Smart grids represent a revolutionary transition in electric power transmission networks. They are designed to significantly improve energy efficiency and finely tune energy utilization, all of which fall under their broader aim of proficient energy management [62]. A pivotal factor in this evolution is the digital transformation that traditional energy systems are undergoing [94]. This digital overhaul brings forth a vast potential to leverage data and insights, enhancing the intelligence of these grids.

Reinforcement learning is an emerging technique in this arena, and its application to smart grids has shown remarkable results. This advanced methodology has proven particularly effective in managing diverse energy systems integrated within the smart grid, such as electric vehicles and smart home appliances. The beauty of reinforcement learning lies in its ability to adapt to varying environmental conditions and incorporate feedback loops, offering a tailored approach to energy consumption [53].

Parallelly, the growing prominence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within the energy sector is reshaping how energy management systems function [41, 70]. These advancements are paving the way for the emergence of microgrids, which can be perceived as a specialized segment within the broader smart grid infrastructure. Microgrids focus on localized energy distribution, fostering more streamlined and efficient consumption patterns, thus reinforcing the objectives of the overarching smart grid framework [6, 62, 33].

Title: reinforcement learning based plug in electric vehicle CHARGING with \
forecasted price
Abstract:
```
this paper proposes a novel demand responsemethod that aims at reducing \
the long term cost of CHARGING the battery of an individual plug in \
electric vehicle (pev). the problem is cast as a daily decision making \
problem for choosing the amount of energy to be charged in the pev \
battery within a day. we model the problem as a markov decision process \
(mdp) with unknown transition probabilities.abatch reinforcement learning \
(rl) algorithm is proposed for learning an optimum cost reducing CHARGING \
policy froma batch of TRANSITION_SAMPLES andmaking cost reducing CHARGING \
decisions in new situations. in order to capture the dayto day \
differences of electricity CHARGING costs, the method makes use of \
ACTUAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICES for the current day and predicted electricity \
prices for the following day. a BAYESIAN_NEURAL_NETWORK is employed for \
predicting the electricity prices. for constructing the \
RL_TRAINING_DATASET, we use historical prices. a linearprogramming based \
method is developed for creating a dataset of optimal CHARGING decisions. \
different CHARGING scenarios are simulated for each day of the historical \
time frame using the set of past electricity prices. SIMULATION_RESULTS \
using real world pricing data demonstrate cost savings of 10% 50% for the \
pev owner when using the proposed CHARGING method.  2016 ieee.

FORECASTING: a SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
in developed countries, BUILDINGS are involved in almost 50% of \
TOTAL_ENERGY_USE and 30% of global green house GAS_EMISSIONS. BUILDINGS' \
OPERATIONAL_ENERGY is highly dependent on VARIOUS_BUILDING physical, \
operational, and FUNCTIONAL_CHARACTERISTICS, as well as meteorological \
and TEMPORAL_PROPERTIES. besides physics based BUILDING_ENERGY modeling, \
MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES can provide faster and higher \
ACCURACY_ESTIMATES, given BUILDINGS' HISTORIC_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_DATA. \
looking beyond INDIVIDUAL_BUILDING_LEVELS, FORECASTING \
BUILDINGS_ENERGY_PERFORMANCE helps city and COMMUNITY_MANAGERS have a \
better understanding of their FUTURE_ENERGY_NEEDS, and plan for \
satisfying them more efficiently. focusing on an URBAN_SCALE, this study \
systematically reviews 70 JOURNAL_ARTICLES, published in the field of \
BUILDING_ENERGY_PERFORMANCE_FORECASTING between 2015 and 2018. the \
RECENT_LITERATURE have been categorized according to five criteria: 1. \
learning method, 2. building type, 3. energy type, 4. input data, and 5. \
time scale. the scarcity of BUILDING_ENERGY_PERFORMANCE_FORECASTING \
studies in URBAN_SCALE versus INDIVIDUAL_LEVEL is considerable. there is \
no study incorporating BUILDING_FUNCTIONALITY in terms of \
SPACE_FUNCTIONALITY_SHARE_PERCENTAGES, nor assessing the effects of \
CLIMATE_CHANGE on URBAN_BUILDINGS_ENERGY_PERFORMANCE using \
MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES and FUTURE_WEATHER_SCENARIOS. there is no \
OPTIMAL_CRITERIA_COMBINATION for achieving the most ACCURATE_MACHINE \
learning based forecast, as there is no UNIVERSAL_MEASURE able to provide \
SUCH_GLOBAL_COMPARISON. ACCURACY_LEVELS are highly correlated with the \

Title: REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS: a \
survey
Abstract:
```
the DYNAMIC_NATURE of SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS can vary \
significantly along with the environment and load change, and they \
represent the features of multivariate, HIGH_COMPLEXITY and uncertainty \
of the NONLINEAR_SYSTEM. moreover, the integration of intermittent \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES and ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_BEHAVIOURS of \
HOUSEHOLDS_INTRODUCE more uncertainty into \
SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS. the operation, control and \
DECISION_MAKING in such an environment definitely require increasing \
intelligence and flexibility in the CONTROL_AND_OPTIMIZATION to ensure \
the QUALITY_OF_SERVICE of SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS. \
REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING is a WIDE_CLASS of OPTIMAL_CONTROL_STRATEGIES that \
uses estimating VALUE_FUNCTIONS from experience, simulation, or search to \
learn in highly dynamic, STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENT. the INTERACTIVE_CONTEXT \
enables REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to develop STRONG_LEARNING_ABILITY and \
HIGH_ADAPTABILITY. REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING does not require the use of the \
model of SYSTEM_DYNAMICS, which makes it suitable for \
SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS with COMPLEX_NONLINEARITY and \
uncertainty. the use of REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING in \
SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS will certainly change the \
TRADITIONAL_ENERGY_UTILIZATION_MODE and bring more intelligence into the \
system. in this survey, an overview of REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING, the demand \
for REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS, \
REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_APPLICATIONS in \
SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_AND_ELECTRIC_SYSTEMS, and future challenges and \
opportunities will be explicitly addressed.  2020

using MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
at present, ENERGY_GENERATION is evolving into a \
SMART_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM that assimilates several GREEN_ENERGY_RESOURCES \
at a distributed level assuring to generate CLEAN_ENERGY without \
producing any HARMFUL_GASES, to have CONSISTENT_OPERATIONAL_PROCEDURES, \
and to improve ENERGY_MANAGEMENT and SUPERVISION_ARRANGEMENTS. the \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES (rers) are considered the best \
SUITABLE_APPROACH to generate ELECTRICAL_POWER at the distributed level \
since they offer benefits to the POWER_SYSTEMS as well as to the \
environment. therefore, this paper presents the RECENT_RESEARCH_WORK on \
multi agents based coordination for the OPTIMAL_MANAGEMENT of \

exploiting rers. the MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM (mas) technique is discussed in \
detail along with the storage and PROTECTION_SYSTEM that solve the \
MICROGRID (mg) CONTROL_AND_MANAGEMENT issues efficiently. several \
platforms to develop the mass are addressed including those that empower \
the mg to CONTROL its configuration, GENERATION_CAPACITY, POWER_FLOW, and \

Title: a review of DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING for \

Abstract:
```
global buildings account for about 30% of the TOTAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION \
and CARBON_EMISSION, raising SEVERE_ENERGY and environmental concerns. \
therefore, it is significant and urgent to develop \
NOVEL_SMART_BUILDING_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT (sbem) technologies for the \
advance of energy efficient and green buildings. however, it is a \
NONTRIVIAL_TASK due to the following challenges. first, it is generally \
difficult to develop an explicit building thermal dynamics model that is \
both accurate and efficient enough for building control. second, there \
are many UNCERTAIN_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS (e.g., RENEWABLE_GENERATION_OUTPUT, \
OUTDOOR_TEMPERATURE, and the number of occupants). third, there are many \
spatially and temporally coupled OPERATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS. fourth, \
BUILDING_ENERGY_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEMS can not be solved in REAL_TIME by \
TRADITIONAL_METHODS when they have extremely LARGE_SOLUTION_SPACES. \
fifthly, TRADITIONAL_BUILDING_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_METHODS have \
RESPECTIVE_APPLICABLE_PREMISES, which means that they have \
LOW_VERSATILITY when confronted with varying BUILDING_ENVIRONMENTS. with \
the RAPID_DEVELOPMENT of internet of THINGS_TECHNOLOGY and \

Title: of ec: a novel energy consumption AWARE_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION for RPL based \
on fuzzy logic.
Abstract:
```
low power and lossy networks (llns) have recently emerged as a promising \
and ATTRACTIVE_PARADIGM. the ipv6 routing protocol for low power and \
lossy networks (RPL), proposed by the ietf roll working group, is \
specifically designed for lln and is compliant with the 6lowpan protocol. \
RPL has gained a SIGNIFICANT_MATURITY, and is still attracting more \
researchers contributing to its improvement. RPL_BUILDS a destination \
oriented DIRECTED_ACYCLIC_GRAPH (dodag) based on a set of metrics and \
constraints through SPECIFIC_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS (ofs). the ofs select \
the best parent of nodes to build and optimize the route. however, the \
STANDARD_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS have some limitations due to the use of a \
single metric. in this paper, we propose a new of based on combined \
metrics using fuzzy logic (of ec). to overcome the limitations of the use \
of a single metric, the proposed of ec considers both the link and the \
node metrics, namely the expected transmission count (etx), hop count \
(hc) and the energy consumption (ec). the SIMULATION_RESULTS demonstrate \
the effectiveness of the new of ec in comparison with the mrhof, entot, \
and of fuzzy in improving RPL_PERFORMANCES in terms of pdr, network \
lifetime, CONVERGENCE_TIME, latency, overhead, and energy consumption. \
our results show that of ec keeps the RPL_OVERALL_EFFICIENCY independent \
from the network topology and the TRANSMISSION_RANGE. moreover, the \
proposed of ec outperforms the other proposals in balancing the energy \
consumption of all nodes in the network.  2018 elsevier ltd

Title: ACCURACY_ANALYSES and model comparison of machine learning adopted in \
building energy consumption prediction
Abstract:
```
it is of great significance to achieve the prediction of building energy \
consumption. however, machine learning, as a promising technique for many \
practical applications, was rarely utilized in this field. the most \
important reason is that the predictive structure with best performance \
is difficult to be determined. to fill the gap, this paper offers one in \
depth review, which focuses on the ACCURACY_ANALYSES and model \
comparisons. specifically, the ACCURACY_ANALYSES were conducted based on \
different types of buildings (e.g. residential building, commercial \
building, government building or educational building), different type of \
TEMPORAL_GRANULARITY (e.g. sub hourly, hourly, daily or annual), as well \
as input/output variables and historical data collections. further, \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and support vector machine (svm), as the \
epidemic models, were compared in terms of their complexity of prediction \
processes, accuracies of results, the amounts of required historical \
data, the numbers of inputs, etc. then the hybrid and single machine \
learning methods were outlined and compared in terms of their strengths \
and weaknesses. in addition, several VITAL_DEFECTS and further research \
directions are presented from a multivariate perspective. we hope that \
machine learning method could capture more attention from investigators \
via our introduction and perspective, due to its potential development of \
accuracy and reliability.  the author(s) 2019.

is noted that PREDICTION_ERROR_INCREASES along with the rise of \
DATA_ENTROPY or the decrease of DATA_SPARSITY. thus, this PAPER_ACCOUNTS \
for both indicators by defining the ENTROPY/sparsity ratio (r). when r is \
low, SUPPORT_VECTOR_REGRESSION (svr) and RANDOM_FOREST (rf) \
REGRESSION_SHOW better accuracy for stay duration and \
ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_PREDICTIONS, respectively. while r is high, a \
diffusion based KERNEL_DENSITY_ESTIMATOR (dkde) performs better for both \
predictions. the three methods are assembled as the proposed ensemble \
predicting ALGORITHM (epa) to improve predicting performance by \
decreasing 11% of the duration and 22% of the \
ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_PREDICTION_ERRORS. the PREDICTION_RESULTS are then \
applied to an OPTIMAL_EV charging SCHEDULING_ALGORITHM to \
MINIMIZE_LOAD_VARIANCE while reducing the ev charging cost. a \
NUMERICAL_SIMULATION using real charging data is conducted to show the \
effectiveness of improved predictions and EV_LOAD_MANAGEMENT. the results \
show that the charging scheduling combined with EPA_PREDICTION can reduce \

this study has reviewed 66 long term EXPERIMENTAL_COMPARISONS on \
SOIL_ORGANIC_CARBON (soc) and TILLAGE_SYSTEMS in mediterranean \
ARABLE_CROPS (from 15 sites located in GREECE, ITALY, MOROCCO and SPAIN), \
with the aim to identify the biophysical and AGRONOMIC_VARIABLES most \
associated with C_SEQUESTRATION_RATE. data were organized in a dataset \
containing BASIC_ENVIRONMENTAL_DESCRIPTORS (elevation, temperature, \
rainfall), information on SOIL_TILLAGE_SYSTEM (conventional, minimum, \
NO_TILLAGE), SOIL_ATTRIBUTES (ph, PARTICLE_SIZE_DISTRIBUTION and \
texture), CROP_ROTATION, fertilization, TIME_LENGTH of the experiment, \
initial and FINAL_SOC_STOCKS. the collected information were analyzed \
using a DATA_MINING approach including spearman non parametric \
correlations, PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_ANALYSIS (PCA), HIERARCHICAL_CLUSTERING \
and step wise MULTIPLE_REGRESSION. tillage, CROP_ROTATION, and \
fertilization were the most SIGNIFICANT_FACTORS affecting \
C_SEQUESTRATION_RATE. non parametric correlations reported \
NEGATIVE_COEFFICIENTS for INITIAL_SOC_STOCK, length of the experiment, \
MINERAL_FERTILIZATION, tillage and PRODUCTION_SYSTEM. \
C_SEQUESTRATION_RATE increased significantly under NO_TILLAGE. \
HIERARCHICAL_CLUSTERING indicates that \

Title: TRANSFER_LEARNING in DEMAND_RESPONSE: a REVIEW of algorithms for data \
efficient modelling and control
Abstract:
```
a number of DECARBONIZATION_SCENARIOS for the ENERGY_SECTOR are built on \
SIMULTANEOUS_ELECTRIFICATION of ENERGY_DEMAND, and DECARBONIZATION of \
ELECTRICITY_GENERATION through RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. however, \
increased ELECTRICITY_DEMAND due to heat and TRANSPORT_ELECTRIFICATION \
and the variability associated with renewables have the potential to \
disrupt STABLE_ELECTRIC_GRID_OPERATION. to address these issues using \
DEMAND_RESPONSE, researchers and practitioners have increasingly turned \
towards automated DECISION_SUPPORT_TOOLS which UTILIZE_MACHINE_LEARNING \
and OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS. however, when applied naively, these \
ALGORITHMS_SUFFER from HIGH_SAMPLE_COMPLEXITY, which means that it is \
often impractical to fit sufficiently COMPLEX_MODELS because of a lack of \
observed data. RECENT_ADVANCES have shown that techniques such as \
TRANSFER_LEARNING can address this problem and improve their PERFORMANCE \
considerably  both in supervised and REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_CONTEXTS. \
SUCH_FORMULATIONS allow models to leverage existing DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE and \
HUMAN_EXPERTISE in addition to SPARSE_OBSERVATIONAL_DATA. more formally, \
TRANSFER_LEARNING embodies all techniques where one aims to increase \
(learning) PERFORMANCE in a TARGET_DOMAIN or task, by using knowledge \
gained in a SOURCE_DOMAIN or task. this paper provides a detailed \
overview of state of the art techniques on applying TRANSFER_LEARNING in \
DEMAND_RESPONSE, showing improvements that can exceed 30% in a variety of \
tasks. we observe that most research to date has focused on \
TRANSFER_LEARNING in the context of ELECTRICITY_DEMAND_PREDICTION, \
although REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based controllers have also seen \
increasing attention. however, a number of limitations remain in these \
studies, including a lack of benchmarks, \
SYSTEMATIC_PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT tracking, and consensus on techniques \
that can help avoid negative transfer.  2021 the authors

Title: MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS_APPLICATION for the SMART_GRID_PROTECTION
Abstract:
```
the SMART_POWER_GRID_BLENDS the BIDIRECTIONAL_ENERGY with \
INFORMATION_FLOW. compared to the TRADITIONAL_POWER_GRID, it requires \
more intelligent and faster control, protection, automation, and \
COMMUNICATION_TECHNIQUES. ultimately, POWER_SYSTEM_PROTECTION, \
FAULT_LOCATION, and isolation have to go through an \
IMMENSE_MODERNIZATION_PROCESS since the previously used \
PROTECTION_TECHNIQUES are no longer usable in the SMART_GRID. this is due \
to the BIDIRECTIONAL_FLOW of energy and dynamics of the \
NETWORK_CONFIGURATION in the SMART_GRID. MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS (mas) \
techniques can enable the POWER_SYSTEM to become smarter, reliable, \
SELF_HEALING, and robust. its decentralized nature and \
OPERATIONAL_ROBUSTNESS make the MAS_APPLICATION a leading technology. in \
this paper, the MAS_ARCHITECTURE that suits the SMART_GRID_APPLICATION is \
proposed. besides, a detailed SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW on the application of mas \
to SMART_GRID_PROTECTION is conducted. the MAS_APPLICATION for \
SELF_HEALING of the SMART_GRID through FAULT_LOCATION, isolation, and \
SERVICE_RESTORATION (FLISR) is also investigated. furthermore, based on \
the MAS_ARCHITECTURE, FAULT_IDENTIFICATION_TECHNIQUE, simulation, and \
VERIFICATION_METHODS implemented, a comparison is made among the ongoing \
RESEARCH_ACTIVITIES on POWER_SYSTEM_PROTECTION and FLISR. consequently, \
the RESEARCH_GAP on POWER_SYSTEM_PROTECTION, FLISR, and SELF_HEALING is \
indicated. finally, the use of IEC_61850 for implementing the \
MAS_TECHNIQUE is discussed. as a result, the use of mas for \
ADAPTIVE_SMART_GRID_PROTECTION, the challenges in the implementation of \
the communication among the agents and outside LABORATORY_APPLICATION of \
the mas for the POWER_SYSTEMS are the RESEARCH_TOPICS that require \
further work.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: OPTIMIZATION of BIOGAS_GENERATION using ANAEROBIC_DIGESTION_MODELS and \
COMPUTATIONAL_INTELLIGENCE_APPROACHES
Abstract:
```
ANAEROBIC_DIGESTION (ad) technology has become popular and is widely used \
due to its ability to produce RENEWABLE_ENERGY from WASTES. the bioenergy \
produced in ANAEROBIC_DIGESTERS could be directly used as fuel, thereby \
reducing the release of BIOGAS to the atmosphere. due to the limited \
knowledge on the DIFFERENT_PROCESS_DISTURBANCES and MICROBIAL_COMPOSITION \
that are vital for the EFFICIENT_OPERATION of ad systems, models and \
CONTROL_STRATEGIES with respect to EXTERNAL_INFLUENCES are needed without \
wasting time and resources. different simple and COMPLEX_MECHANISTIC and \
data driven modeling approaches have been developed to describe the \
processes taking place in the ad system. MICROBIAL_ACTIVITIES have been \
incorporated in some of these models to serve as a PREDICTIVE_TOOL in \
BIOLOGICAL_PROCESSES. the flexibility and power of \
COMPUTATIONAL_INTELLIGENCE of EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHMS (eas) as \
DIRECT_SEARCH_ALGORITHMS to solve MULTIOBJECTIVE_PROBLEMS and generate \
PARETO_OPTIMAL_SOLUTIONS have also been exploited. thus, this paper \
reviews state of the art models based on the \
COMPUTATIONAL_OPTIMIZATION_METHODS for renewable and \
SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_OPTIMIZATION. this PAPER_DISCUSSES the DIFFERENT_TYPES \
of MODEL_APPROACHES to enhance ad processes for BIOENERGY_GENERATION. the \
OPTIMIZATION_AND_CONTROL strategies using eas for advanced \
REACTOR_PERFORMANCE and BIOGAS_PRODUCTION are highlighted. this \
information would be of interest to a DYNAMIC_GROUP of researchers, \
including microbiologists and PROCESS_ENGINEERS, thereby offering the \
latest RESEARCH_ADVANCES and importance of ad technology in the \

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING and DEEP_LEARNING_METHODS for enhancing \
BUILDING_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY and indoor environmental quality a review
Abstract:
```
the BUILT_ENVIRONMENT sector is responsible for almost one third of the \
world's FINAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION. hence, seeking PLAUSIBLE_SOLUTIONS to \
MINIMISE_BUILDING_ENERGY_DEMANDS and mitigate \
ADVERSE_ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS is necessary. ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) \
techniques such as machine and DEEP_LEARNING have been increasingly and \
successfully applied to develop solutions for the BUILT_ENVIRONMENT. this \
review provided a CRITICAL_SUMMARY of the existing literature on the \
machine and DEEP_LEARNING_METHODS for the BUILT_ENVIRONMENT over the \
PAST_DECADE, with SPECIAL_REFERENCE to holistic approaches. different ai \
based techniques employed to resolve interconnected problems related to \
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (hvac) systems and \
ENHANCE_BUILDING_PERFORMANCES were reviewed, including energy forecasting \
and management, indoor AIR_QUALITY and occupancy comfort/satisfaction \
prediction, OCCUPANCY_DETECTION and recognition, and FAULT_DETECTION and \
diagnosis. the PRESENT_STUDY explored existing ai based techniques \
focusing on the framework, methodology, and performance. the literature \
highlighted that selecting the most SUITABLE_MACHINE_LEARNING and \
DEEP_LEARNING_MODEL for solving a problem could be challenging. the \
RECENT_EXPLOSIVE_GROWTH experienced by the RESEARCH_AREA has led to \
hundreds of MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS being applied to building \
performance related studies. the literature showed that existing \
RESEARCH_STUDIES considered a WIDE_RANGE of scope/scales (from an hvac \
component to URBAN_AREAS) and TIME_SCALES (minute to year). this makes it \
difficult to find an OPTIMAL_ALGORITHM for a SPECIFIC_TASK or case. the \
studies also employed a WIDE_RANGE of EVALUATION_METRICS, adding to the \
challenge. further developments and more SPECIFIC_GUIDELINES are required \
for the BUILT_ENVIRONMENT field to encourage best practices in evaluating \
and selecting models. the literature also showed that while machine and \
DEEP_LEARNING had been successfully applied in BUILDING_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY \
research, most of the studies are still at the experimental or testing \
stage, and there are limited studies which implemented machine and \
DEEP_LEARNING_STRATEGIES in ACTUAL_BUILDINGS and conducted the post \
occupancy evaluation.  2022

Title: FUZZY_ROUGH_SET based ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM for SELF_SUSTAINABLE \
SMART_CITY
Abstract:
```
a SMART_CITY (sc) is a modernized URBAN_COMMUNITY, which \
INCORPORATES_INFORMATION and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGY (ict) into the \
existing PHYSICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE. it offers reliable and uninterrupted \
services such as intelligent transport and ENERGY_CONSERVATION to its \
residents. among the VARIOUS_SERVICES offered, a continuous and \
widespread supply of ELECTRICITY_DRAWS the MAXIMUM_ATTENTION. moreover, a \
SUBSTANTIAL_AMOUNT of this electricity is utilized by heating and COOLING \
loads, making them SIGNIFICANT_CONTRIBUTORS of GLOBAL_WARMING. keeping \
focus on these points, a sc is modeled in this paper, \
WHEREIN_ELECTRICITY_CONSUMPTION is minimized by modifying the traditional \
heating and COOLING system. the proposed system collects SOLAR_HEAT and \
recovers INDUSTRIAL_WASTE_HEAT to deliver heating and COOLING services to \
the SC_RESIDENTS. for the purpose of storing the HEAT_ENERGY, a \
SEASONAL_THERMAL_ENERGY_STORAGE (stes) system has been proposed. the \
proposed STES_SYSTEM_SUPPLIES stored THERMAL_ENERGY to heat driven \
COOLING and heating equipments. moreover, \
CENTRAL_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM (cems) is also modeled for monitoring, \
regulating and controlling the flow of THERMAL_ENERGY. the designed cems \
consists of a FUZZY_ROUGH_SET controller for SCHEDULING_HEAT to cater the \
INSTANTANEOUS_THERMAL_ENERGY_REQUIREMENTS. FUZZY_ROUGH_SET has been used \
because it eliminates the issues of vagueness, uncertainty, and ensures \
efficient real time computations. RESULTS_DEPICT that the HEAT_ENERGY \
obtained from SOLAR_THERMAL_COLLECTORS and INDUSTRIAL_WASTES is able to \
meet the requirements of the sc after SCHEDULING it using FUZZY_ROUGH_SET \
algorithm.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

Abstract:
```
BUILDING_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS provide users with desired \

systems. many studies related to the ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM in \
SMART_BUILDINGS have been conducted. however, the THERMAL_COMFORT of \
occupants at lower ENERGY_CONSUMPTION is a SIGNIFICANT_CHALLENGE to \
researchers. therefore, in this study, a NEW_SMART_APPROACH is presented, \
which has the ability to take into account the impact of the next \
WALL_NEIGHBORS, and the OUTSIDE_TEMPERATURE to reduce the \
ENERGY_CONSUMPTION of an HVAC_SYSTEM without affecting the \
THERMAL_COMFORT of occupants. our model is based on four strategies \
implemented and simulated using the 3D_MODELING interface of the \
rhino/grasshopper visual programming tool. the CONTROL_SYSTEM of our \
OFFICE_BUILDING intends to meet the ansi/ashrae standard, which defines \
the THERMAL_COMFORT of occupants. the proposed system takes into account \
the effect of DIFFERENT_HEAT_LOADS of a building, such as EQUIPMENT_LOAD, \
LIGHTING density, and the number of people per area. our machine to \
machine communication based approach is capable of reducing \
ENERGY_CONSUMPTION while keeping the occupants thermally comfortable. \

Title: LARGE_SCALE RESIDENTIAL_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_PRIORITIZATION enabled by \
MACHINE_LEARNING
Abstract:
```
cost effective ENERGY_EFFICIENCY improvements in RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS \
can realize 30% energy reduction within this ENERGY_SECTOR for the usa. \
unfortunately, audits on residences to IDENTIFY_POTENTIAL_SAVINGS, \
generally based on detailed ENERGY_MODELS, tend to over estimate \
anticipated savings. this leads to wariness on the part of \
POTENTIAL_INVESTORS. we address this issue by taking an integrated data \
and physics based approach, using RESIDENTIAL_BUILDING_GEOMETRICAL and \
ENERGY_SYSTEM_CHARACTERISTICS (e.g., envelope, appliances, and \
HVAC_SYSTEMS), as well as HISTORICAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION for each \
residence and WEATHER_DATA, to predict \
MONTHLY_NATURAL_GAS_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and savings from the adoption of \
INDIVIDUAL_ENERGY saving measures. this approach requires only those \
geometrical and ENERGY_SYSTEM_CHARACTERISTICS associated with the \
greatest potential for realized savings which are also easy to obtain. we \
construct a dataset from a collection of houses with a WIDE_RANGE of \
ENERGY_EFFECTIVENESS, and train a single STATISTICAL_MODEL that \
accurately predicts NATURAL_GAS_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION in any of the \
INDIVIDUAL_RESIDENCES. the model is then used to estimate the savings \
from most IMPACTFUL_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_INVESTMENTS for \
INDIVIDUAL_RESIDENCES, as well as the collective grouping. the \
SPECIFIC_CASE considered here INVOLVES_HUNDREDS of university owned \
STUDENT_RESIDENCES in the u.s. MIDWEST. the resulting MACHINE_LEARNING \
derived model is used to predict MONTHLY_NATURAL_GAS_CONSUMPTION with a \
mean squared error of 0.00023 for unitary scaled cross validation data. \
we use a nearest NEIGHBOR_APPROACH to VALIDATE_SAVINGS_ESTIMATES for \
virtually improved residences, identifying the SURROGATE_RESIDENCE most \
like an improved residence. this VALIDATION_DEMONSTRATES a \
SAVINGS_PREDICTION_ACCURACY to within 3.5% for most of the measures \
considered. the validated models are shown capable of prioritizing \
INVESTMENTS among the collective of residences considered. \
SEQUENTIAL_ADOPTION of the most cost effective ENERGY_EFFICIENCY measure \
among a group of RESIDENCES_RENDERS a TOTAL_ENERGY_REDUCTION of 36%. the \
PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS of this research are significant. this integrated \
MACHINE_LEARNING and physics based approach to ESTIMATE_SAVINGS could be \
used in any UTILITY_DISTRICT and throughout all of the usa to enable \
district wide RESIDENTIAL_ENERGY_REDUCTION based upon SEQUENTIAL_ADOPTION \
of the most cost effective energy measures.  2019, springer nature b.v.

Title: FUZZY_LOGIC_CONTROL of HYBRID_SYSTEMS including RENEWABLE_ENERGY in \
microgrids
Abstract:
```
with a growing demand for more ENERGY from subscribers, a \
TRADITIONAL_ELECTRIC_GRID is unable to meet new challenges, in the \
REMOTE_AREAS remains the extension of the CONVENTIONAL_ELECTRIC_NETWORK \
very hard to do make prohibitively expensive. therefore, a new advanced \
generation of traditional electrical is inevitable and indispensable to \
move toward an effective, economical, green, clean and self correcting \
POWER_SYSTEM. the most well known term used to define this next \
GENERATION_POWER_SYSTEM is MICRO_GRID (mg) based on \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (res). since, the ENERGY produced by res are not \
constant at all times, a WIDE_RANGE of ENERGY_CONTROL_TECHNIQUES must be \
involved to provide a RELIABLE_POWER to consumers. to solve this problem \
in this paper we present a FUZZY_LOGIC_CONTROL of isolated HYBRID_SYSTEMS \
(hres) including RENEWABLE_ENERGY in micro grids to maintain a stability \
in voltage and FREQUENCY_OUTPUT especially in the STANDALONE_APPLICATION. \
the considered hres combine a WIND_TURBINE (wt) and photovoltaic (pv) \
panels as PRIMARY_ENERGY_SOURCES and an ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEM (ess) based \
on battery as a BACKUP_SOLUTION. SIMULATION_RESULTS obtained from \
matlab/simulink environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed \
algorithm in decreasing the ELECTRICITY_BILL of customer.  copyright \

Title: BLOCKCHAIN and MACHINE_LEARNING for FUTURE_SMART_GRIDS: a review
Abstract:
```
developments such as the increasing ELECTRICAL_ENERGY_DEMAND, growth of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES, CYBERPHYSICAL_SECURITY_THREATS, increased \
penetration of ELECTRIC_VEHICLES (evs), and UNPREDICTABLE_BEHAVIOR of \
prosumers and EV_USERS_POSE a range of challenges to the \
ELECTRIC_POWER_SYSTEM. to address these challenges, a decentralized \
system using BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY and MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES for \
secure communication, distributed ENERGY_MANAGEMENT and decentralized \
ENERGY_TRADING between prosumers is required. BLOCKCHAIN enables secure \
distributed TRUST_PLATFORMS, ADDRESSES_OPTIMIZATION and reliability \
challenges, and allows p2p distributed ENERGY_EXCHANGE as well as \
FLEXIBILITY_SERVICES between customers. on the other hand, \
MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_SMART_GRID_OPERATIONS by \
using PREDICTION_MODELS and BIG_DATA_ANALYSIS. motivated from these \
facts, in this review, we examine the potential of combining \
BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY and MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES in the development \
of SMART_GRID and investigate the benefits achieved by using both \
techniques for the FUTURE_SMART_GRID_SCENARIO. further, we discuss \
research challenges and FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS of applying BLOCKCHAIN \
and MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES for SMART_GRIDS both individually as well \
as combining them together. the identified areas that require \
SIGNIFICANT_RESEARCH are DEMAND_MANAGEMENT in POWER_GRIDS, improving the \
SECURITY of grids with better CONSENSUS_MECHANISMS, ELECTRIC_VEHICLE \
charging systems, scheduling of the ENTIRE_GRID_SYSTEM, designing secure \
microgrids, and the interconnection of DIFFERENT_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORKS. \

Title: REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based ADAPTIVE_POWER sharing of \
BATTERY/SUPERCAPACITORS hybrid storage in ELECTRIC_VEHICLES
Abstract:
```
the BATTERY_LIFETIME of ELECTRIC_VEHICLES (evs) is affected by hot \
temperatures and high charging and discharging EFFECTIVE_BATTERY current. \
hybrid energy storage systems (hess) coupling the best attributes of the \
BATTERY with SUPERCAPACITORS (scs) help extend the BATTERY_LIFETIME and \
improve the ev storage performances. the key to a SUCCESSFUL_HESS at \
extending the BATTERY_LIFETIME is to adopt the \
APPROPRIATE_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM (ems) that ensures the best \
POWER_SHARING between BATTERY and scs. this paper proposes an innovative \
REAL_TIME_OPTIMIZATION based ems with LOW_COMPUTATIONAL_COSTS and high \
adaptability to variable and commute driving profiles. the proposed ems \
is organized in two levels. the lower LEVEL_IMPLEMENTS a rule based \
frequency POWER_SHARING control. the \
UPPER_LEVEL_PERFORMS_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (rl) optimizations to learn \
and adapt the best POWER_SHARING configuration considering \
REAL_TIME_INFORMATION and ACTUAL_LOAD_CONDITIONS. an experimental test \
bench is developed and experimental measurements are conducted. the \
obtained results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed ems to \
provide the best trade offs between SIMPLE_IMPLEMENTATION, \
COMPUTATION_TIME, SOLUTION_OPTIMALITY, REAL_TIME_PERFORMANCE, and good \
adaption to VARIABLE_DRIVING_CONDITIONS.  2020 taylor & francis group, \

the KEY_DIRECTION of POLITICAL_ACTIONS in the field of \
SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of the ENERGY_SECTOR and economy is the process \
of ENERGY_TRANSFORMATION (DECARBONIZATION) and increasing the share of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (res) in the supply of PRIMARY_ENERGY. \
regardless of the INDISPUTABLE_ADVANTAGES, res are referred to as \
UNSTABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. a POSSIBLE_SOLUTION might be the development of \
the concept of HYDROGEN_SUPPLY_CHAINS, especially the so called \
GREEN_HYDROGEN obtained in the process of electrolysis from electricity \
produced from res. the aim of the research undertaken in the article is \
to identify the scope of research carried out in the area of \
HYDROGEN_SUPPLY_CHAINS and to link this research with the issues of the \
operation of ELECTRICITY_DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS powered by res. as a \
result of the SCOPING_REVIEW, and the application of the TEXT_MINING \
method using the IRAMUTEQ_TOOL, which includes the analysis of the \
content of 12 REVIEW_ARTICLES presenting the \
CURRENT_RESEARCH_ACHIEVEMENTS in this field over the last three years \
(20162020), it was established that the issues related to \
HYDROGEN_SUPPLY_CHAINS, including GREEN_HYDROGEN, are still not \
significantly associated with the problem of the operation of \

Title: NSGA_II MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION algorithm for \
ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL of HYBRID_ELECTRIC_VEHICLE
Abstract:
```
the currently existing ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL_OPTIMIZATION for \
HYBRID_ELECTRIC_VEHICLE (hev) mainly focuses on FUEL_ECONOMY. apart from \
this, there has been some consideration of the impact of emissions, but \
almost no attention has been paid to DRIVABILITY_PERFORMANCE. therefore, \
from the point of view of MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION, the influences \
of FUEL_ECONOMY, emission and DRIVABILITY_PERFORMANCE on the \
ENERGY_MANAGEMENT are comprehensively considered for a PARALLEL_HEV. the \
ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL_PARAMETERS and DRIVELINE_PARAMETERS are \
selected to be optimized parameters. then, the NSGA_II (fast \
NON_DOMINATED_SORTING_GENETIC_ALGORITHM_II) algorithm is proposed to \
solve the MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION problem. furthermore, the \
MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION method for HEV_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL is \
established and comparatively simulated with the parallel \
ELECTRIC_ASSIST_CONTROL_STRATEGY. the results show that the \
EVALUATION_INDEX of DRIVABILITY_DECREASES by 27.12% from the maximum and \
the AVERAGE_ENHANCEMENT_EFFECT of optimization falls by 20.84%. the \
EVALUATION_INDEX of FUEL_ECONOMY declines by 22.30% from the maximum and \
the AVERAGE_INDEX_DROPS by 20.26%. the COMPREHENSIVE_INDEX of \
EMISSION_PERFORMANCE_DESCENDS by 11.33% from the maximum. the proposed \
MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION algorithm has GOOD_CONVERGENCE and \
distribution, and obtains more PARETO_OPTIMAL_SOLUTION sets, which can \
provide more selectivity in building \
HEV_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL_STRATEGIES.  imeche 2018.

Abstract:
```
ELECTRIC_VEHICLES (evs) are playing an IMPORTANT_ROLE in POWER_SYSTEMS \
due to their SIGNIFICANT_MOBILITY and flexibility features. nowadays, the \
increasing penetration of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES has been observed in \
MODERN_POWER_SYSTEMS, which brings many benefits for improving \
CLIMATE_CHANGE and accelerating the low carbon transition. however, the \
intermittent and UNSTABLE_NATURE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES_INTRODUCES \
new challenges to both the planning and operation of POWER_SYSTEMS. to \
address these issues, VEHICLE_TO_GRID (v2g) technology has been gradually \
recognized as a VALID_SOLUTION to provide \
VARIOUS_ANCILLARY_SERVICE_PROVISIONS for POWER_SYSTEMS. many studies have \
developed model based OPTIMIZATION_METHODS for EV_DISPATCH_PROBLEMS. \
nevertheless, this type of method cannot effectively handle the highly \
dynamic and STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENT due to the complexity of \
POWER_SYSTEMS. REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (rl), a model free and \
ONLINE_LEARNING_METHOD, can capture VARIOUS_UNCERTAINTIES through \
NUMEROUS_INTERACTIONS with the environment and adapt to \
VARIOUS_STATE_CONDITIONS in real time. as a result, using advanced \
RL_ALGORITHMS to solve VARIOUS_EV_DISPATCH_PROBLEMS has attracted a surge \
of attention in RECENT_YEARS, leading to many OUTSTANDING_RESEARCH_PAPERS \
and IMPORTANT_FINDINGS. this paper provides a COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of \
POPULAR_RL_ALGORITHMS categorized by single agent rl and multi agent rl, \
and summarizes how these advanced algorithms can be applied to \
VARIOUS_EV_DISPATCH_PROBLEMS, including grid to vehicle (g2v), vehicle to \
home (v2h), and v2g. finally, key challenges and \
IMPORTANT_FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS are discussed, which involve five \
aspects: (a) DATA_QUALITY and availability; (b) ENVIRONMENT_SETUP; (c) \

Abstract:
```
power consuming entities such as high performance computing (hpc) sites \

technology. in business, hpc is used to enhance the \
PRODUCT_DELIVERY_TIME, reduce the PRODUCTION_COST, and decrease the time \
it takes to develop a NEW_PRODUCT. today's high level of computing power \
from supercomputers comes at the expense of consuming large amounts of \
electric power. it is necessary to consider reducing the energy required \
by the computing systems and the resources needed to operate these \
computing systems to minimize the energy utilized by hpc entities. the \
database could improve SYSTEM_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY by sampling all the \
components' POWER_CONSUMPTION at REGULAR_INTERVALS and the information \
contained in a database. the information stored in the database will \
serve as input data for energy efficiency optimization. more so, device \

MAIN_AIM of this paper is to gather a database for the OPTIMIZATION of \
chps, demonstrate the effect of the applied OPTIMIZATION_METHODS on the \
OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS, and finally, introduce the most EFFICIENT_METHODS. \
the most significant feature of this paper is that it covers all types of \
CHP_OPTIMIZATION_ISSUES including SCHEDULING, sizing, and designing \
problems, finding the extent of each OPTIMIZATION_ISSUE in the \
RELEVANT_PAPERS in the last decade. based on the findings, in the \
SINGLE_OBJECTIVE problems the COMBINED_HEAT_AND_POWER ECONOMIC_DISPATCH \
(chped) issue as a subcategory of the SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS is introduced \
as the most paid topic; the DESIGNING_ISSUE is known as the lowest paid \

CHP_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEMS has been conducted with an almost \
SIMILAR_SHARE. the COMBINED_HEAT_AND_POWER ECONOMIC_EMISSION_DISPATCH \
(chpeed) problem with the most share, and the sizing issue with the \
lowest share. the chp designing and sizing OPTIMIZATION_ISSUES could be \
introduced as topics to work on more in the future. additionally, the \
NUMERICAL_RESULTS of chped and chpeed problems solved by \
VARIOUS_ALGORITHMS are presented and compared. in this regard, specified \

ENERGY_PROFESSIONALS
Abstract:
```
the transition to RENEWABLE_PRODUCTION and SMART_GRIDS is driving a \
MASSIVE_INVESTMENT to BATTERY_STORAGES, and REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (rl) \
has recently emerged as a potentially DISRUPTIVE_TECHNOLOGY for their \
CONTROL_AND_OPTIMIZATION of BATTERY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS. a surge of papers \
has appeared in the last two years applying REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to the \
optimization of BATTERY_STORAGES in buildings, ENERGY_COMMUNITIES, \

Title: SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW on DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based ENERGY_MANAGEMENT \
for DIFFERENT_BUILDING_TYPES
Abstract:
```
owing to the HIGH_ENERGY_DEMAND of buildings, which accounted for 36% of \
the GLOBAL_SHARE in 2020, they are one of the CORE_TARGETS for \
ENERGY_EFFICIENCY research and regulations. hence, coupled with the \
increasing complexity of decentralized POWER_GRIDS and \
HIGH_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PENETRATION, the inception of SMART_BUILDINGS is \
becoming increasingly urgent. data driven \
BUILDING_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS (bems) based on \
DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (drl) have attracted \
SIGNIFICANT_RESEARCH_INTEREST, particularly in RECENT_YEARS, primarily \
owing to their ability to overcome many of the challenges faced by \
CONVENTIONAL_CONTROL_METHODS related to real time building modelling, \
multi objective optimization, and the generalization of bems for \
EFFICIENT_WIDE_DEPLOYMENT. a prisma based SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT of a \
LARGE_DATABASE of 470 papers was conducted to review RECENT_ADVANCEMENTS \
in drl based bems for DIFFERENT_BUILDING_TYPES, their \
RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS, and KNOWLEDGE_GAPS. five BUILDING_TYPES were \
identified: residential, offices, educational, DATA_CENTRES, and other \
COMMERCIAL_BUILDINGS. their COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS was conducted based on \
the types of appliances and systems controlled by the bems, \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INTEGRATION, dr, and UNIQUE_SYSTEM_OBJECTIVES other than \
energy, such as cost, and comfort. moreover, it is worth considering that \

Title: improving PRIMARY_FREQUENCY_RESPONSE in networked MICROGRID_OPERATIONS \
using multilayer perceptron driven REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING
Abstract:
```
INDIVIDUAL_MICROGRIDS can improve the reliability of POWER_SYSTEMS during \
EXTREME_EVENTS, and networked MICROGRIDS can further improve efficiency \
through RESOURCE_SHARING and increase the resilience of critical end use \
loads. however, networked MICROGRID_OPERATIONS can be subject to \
LARGE_TRANSIENTS due to switching and end use loads, which can cause \
DYNAMIC_INSTABILITY and lead to SYSTEM_COLLAPSE. these transients are \
especially prevalent in MICROGRIDS with HIGH_PENETRATIONS of grid \
following inverter connected RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES, which do not \
provide the SYSTEM_INERTIA or FAST_FREQUENCY_RESPONSE needed to mitigate \
the transients. one POTENTIAL_MITIGATION is to engage the existing \
GENERATOR_CONTROLS to reduce SYSTEM_VOLTAGE in response to a \
FREQUENCY_DEVIATION, thereby reducing load and improving \
PRIMARY_FREQUENCY_RESPONSE. this STUDY_INVESTIGATES the use of a \
REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based controller trained over several \
SWITCHING_TRANSIENT scenarios to MODIFY_GENERATOR controls during \
LARGE_FREQUENCY_DEVIATIONS. compared to previously used \
PROPORTIONAL_INTEGRAL_CONTROLLERS, the proposed controller can improve \
PRIMARY_FREQUENCY_RESPONSE while adapting to changes in SYSTEM_TOPOLOGIES \
and conditions.  2020 institution of engineering and technology. all \

we report on the CURRENT_SCENARIO of RENEWABLE_ENERGY in BANGLADESH and \
the most SIGNIFICANT_POTENTIAL of SOLAR_ENERGYS_CONTRIBUTION among \
MULTIPLE_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES in mitigating ENERGY_DEMAND. one \
MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this analysis was to outline the OVERALL_VIEW of \
SOLAR_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS in BANGLADESH to date, as well as the ongoing \
development of SUCH_PROJECTS. the technical and \
THEORETICAL_SOLAR_ENERGY_POTENTIAL and the technologies available to \
HARVEST_SOLAR_ENERGY were also investigated. a detailed techno economic \
design of SOLAR_POWER_APPLICATIONS for the GARMENT_INDUSTRY was also \
simulated to determine the potential of SOLAR_ENERGY for this \
SPECIFIC_SCENARIO. additionally, RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POLICIES applied in \
BANGLADESH to date are discussed comprehensively, with an emphasis on \
various ongoing projects undertaken by the government. moreover, we \
elaborate GLOBAL_INSIGHT into SOLAR_POWER_APPLICATIONS and compare \
bangladeshs CURRENT_SOLAR_POWER_SCENARIO with that of other \

Title: new self balancing 7 level inverter with coupled inductors for 1  grid \
connected RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS with VOLTAGE_BOOSTING capability
Abstract:
```
in this study, a new self balancing 7 level inverter (sb7li) TOPOLOGY, \
suitable for interfacing the LOW_VOLTAGE_RENEWABLES with the POWER_GRID, \
is proposed that uses coupled inductors to generate ADDITIONAL_LEVELS in \
the OUTPUT_VOLTAGE. owing to the presence of a self balancing circuit, \
the voltage across the two INPUT_DC_CAPACITORS is self balanced by \
charging them in series and discharging them in parallel. the self \
balancing feature of the proposed sb7li also obviates the sensing of \
INPUT_DC_CAPACITORS' voltages. the sb7li is controlled using a novel \
multi sine wave pulse width modulation strategy. a SIGNIFICANT_ADVANTAGE \
of the proposed sb7li TOPOLOGY is that it uses fewer POWER_COMPONENTS in \
comparison with traditional multi level inverter topologies, which \
ensures higher POWER_DENSITY and COMPACT_CIRCUITS. this also improves the \
OVERALL_EFFICIENCY of the system and reduces the cost. further, a \
modified version of the sb7li is also presented with a reduced number of \
POWER_COMPONENTS. an ADDITIONAL_ADVANTAGE of coupled inductors is their \
filtering action on the OUTPUT_VOLTAGE/current, which reduces the \
OVERALL_FILTER_REQUIREMENTS. sb7li can be easily extended to an n level, \
3  application. the proposed sb7li and modified sb7li are validated \
through simulations in MATLAB/simulink and HARDWARE_EXPERIMENTS on 300 \

Title: iterative learning control of energy management system: survey on multi \
agent system framework
Abstract:
```
this paper presents a BRIEF_SURVEY of RECENT_WORKS on iterative learning \
control (ilc) of energy management system (ems) based on a framework of \
multi agent system (mas). ilc is a control methodology which is \
especially suitable for dynamical systems whose control tasks are \
executed in a finite time interval and are repeated over and over. the \
key idea of ilc is to take AVAILABLE_SYSTEM_INFORMATION in the past and \
current runs, to generate the control input for the next run. ems is a \
computer based system to monitor energy consumption, control operation, \
and OPTIMIZE_ENERGY_SUPPLIES and demands. ems can be naturally modeled as \
mas since each power generated or powerconsumed component of ems can be \
cast as agent. each agent of mas is a dynamical system itself and has its \
OWN_TARGET such as tracking desired trajectory and minimizing energy. \
moreover, there are common objectives of ems which aim to attain its \
energy efficiency, reliability and optimality. then one agent can \
cooperate with other agents to achieve some global objectives, in \
addition to their OWN_LOCAL_GOALS, by exchanging information with other \
agents. lastly, we will explore some OPEN_RESEARCH_PROBLEMS and their \
POTENTIAL_APPLICATIONS.  2016, chulalongkorn university 1. all rights \

Abstract:
```
the SMART_GRID merges CYBER_PHYSICAL_SYSTEMS (cps) infrastructure with \
INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES (ict) to ensure \

the ATTACK_SURFACE against the ELECTRICITY_GRID, which is vulnerable to a \
wider range of CYBERATTACKS. in particular, DENIAL_OF_SERVICE (dos) \
attacks might impact both the COMMUNICATION_NETWORK and the cyber \

in RECENT_YEARS, there has been a SIGNIFICANT_GROWTH in demand response \
(dr) as a cost effective technique of providing flexibility and, as a \
result, improving the dependability of ENERGY_SYSTEMS. although the tasks \
associated with demand side management (dsm) are extremely complex, the \
use of large scale data and the FREQUENT_REQUIREMENT for near real time \
decisions mean that ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) has recently emerged as \
a KEY_TECHNOLOGY for enabling dsm. OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM_METHODS can be \

set of consumers to respond to, learning their attributes and \
preferences, DYNAMIC_PRICING, DEVICE_SCHEDULING, and control, as well as \
determining the most EFFECTIVE_WAY to incentive and REWARD_PARTICIPANTS \
in DR_SCHEMES fairly and effectively. the \
IMPLEMENTATION_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM_NEEDS PROPER_SELECTION to mitigate \
the cost of ENERGY_CONSUMPTION. due to that reason, this PAPER_OUTLINES \
various challenges and opportunities in developing, utilizing, \
controlling, and scheduling the dr scheme's optimization algorithm. in \
addition, several issues in applications and advantages of \
OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES in ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE approaches are \
discussed. the importance of implementing demand response mechanisms in \

(pdl). TRADITIONAL_POINT FORECASTING_METHODS including statistical, \
MACHINE_LEARNING (ml), and DEEP_LEARNING (dl) are extensively \
investigated in terms of their applicability to ENERGY_FORECASTING. in \

Title: a NOVEL_SCHEME for ISLAND_DETECTION in microgrids based on \
FUZZY_C_MEANS_CLUSTERING technique
Abstract:
```
microgrids (mgs) are capable to work at DIFFERENT_OPERATION_MODES, namely \
grid connected or islanded, which make a significant change in the \
NETWORK_FAULT CURRENT_LEVEL. these changes may lead to problems and \
should be detected fast to do the PROPER_PROTECTION_ACTIONS accordingly \
and prevent blackouts. moreover, some ISLAND_DETECTION_METHODS_SUFFER \
from the drawbacks of HIGH_COMPUTATION_BURDEN and time consuming \
procedure of TRAINING_DATA to detect the islanded mode. for this purpose, \
in this paper, a faster and less \
COMPUTATION_BURDEN_ISLAND_DETECTION_SCHEME without the need for \
TRAINING_DATA is proposed which detects the islanded mode by analyzing \
the fault CURRENT_DATA obtained from a continuous sampling using the \
PHASOR_MEASUREMENT_UNIT (pmu). the sampled data are utilized in the fuzzy \
c means (fcm) clustering to determine the NETWORK_OPERATION_MODE. the \
proposed scheme works in two phases. in the OFFLINE_PHASE, the root mean \
square (rms) of the CURRENT_AMPLITUDE for islanded mode is determined, \
and in the ONLINE_PHASE, the center of the measured data is compared to \
the RMS_VALUE to detect the MG_OPERATION_MODE at a \
DECISION_MAKING_PROCEDURE. it is proved that the proposed \
ISLAND_DETECTION_SCHEME is an APPLICABLE_TECHNIQUE for detecting the \
islanded mode in mgs.  2021 the author(s)

development of islanding, actions carried out during islanding, and the \
approaches utilized to recognize islanding are detailed, is entirely \
necessary for this study. in this paper the author used reinforcement \
learning method which is a technique for introducing machines to learn by \

Title: drdc: DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based DUTY_CYCLE for \
ENERGY_HARVESTING_BODY_SENSOR_NODE
Abstract:
```
nowadays, WIRELESS_BODY_AREA_NETWORKS are the center of attention for \
PATIENTS_HEALTH_DATA monitoring. in these networks, the SENSOR_NODES deal \
with the limited ENERGY of batteries to provide SUSTAINABLE_SERVICES. \
unlimited ENERGY supply by ENERGY_HARVESTERS in these nodes as \
complementary to batteries makes perform in a STABLE_STATE. however, the \
harvested ENERGY has an irregular and UNPREDICTABLE_RATE. when the data \
sensed by the sensor is stable, the CONTINUOUS_ACTIVITY of the \
ENERGY_HARVESTING BODY_NODE (eh bn) is necessary. also, it can fully \
discharge the eh bn ENERGY if the HARVESTABLE_ENERGY_RATE is low. \
therefore, it is required that eh bn to be in sleep and WAKE_MODES \
periodically to adjust the DUTY_CYCLE for eh bn. \
REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS perform nicely in determining the \
DUTY_CYCLE under UNCERTAIN_CONDITIONS. previous rl based methods for \
determining the bn's DUTY_CYCLE have two FUNDAMENTAL_PROBLEMS: (1) \
BN_SUFFERS from the EMERGENCY_PACKET_LOSS or unnecessary frequent \
sleeping and waking, and (2) discretization of the PROBLEM_SPACE does not \
ensure the determination of the OPTIMAL_DUTY_CYCLE. this paper proposes a \
NEW_METHOD for determining the eh bn's DUTY_CYCLE based on \
DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (drdc). the novelties of drdc are as follows: \
(1) considers the CHANGE_RATE of data sensed by bn in addition to its \
ENERGY to avoid the EMERGENCY_PACKET_LOSS and unnecessary frequent \
sleep/wake, (2) uses deep q network (dqn) with LIGHT_NEURAL_NETWORK for \
accurately determining bn's DUTY_CYCLE, (3) applies a three layer \
communication ARCHITECTURAL_MODEL when there are EXTREME_LIMITATIONS in \
BN_RESOURCES to preserve the MEMORY_CONSTRAINTS and COMPUTATIONAL_POWER \
of eh bn. in this ARCHITECTURAL_MODEL, the algorithm is executed on a \
LOCAL_SERVER, and only the trained policy is transmitted to eh bn. (4) \
designs a REWARD_FUNCTION to realize the SUITABLE_PERFORMANCE of the \
DQN_ALGORITHM. this function simultaneously depends on the eh bn ENERGY, \
CHANGE_RATE of the sensed data, and SLEEP_TIME and can balance these \
parameters. results of simulations suggest that the proposed \
METHOD_DECREASES the eh bn DUTY_CYCLE by about 28% and the DATA_OVERHEAD \
by more than 50% on average relative to SIMILAR_STUDIES.  2023 the \

Abstract:
```
the move towards RENEWABLE_ENERGY and TECHNOLOGICAL_ADVANCEMENTS in the \

the popularity of MICROGRIDS. the popularity of these decentralised \
applications has coincided with advancements in the field of \
telecommunications allowing for the EFFICIENT_IMPLEMENTATION of these \

increase in the ATTACK_SURFACE of these systems, resulting in an increase \
in the number of cyber attacks against them. \
PREVENTATIVE_NETWORK_SECURITY_MECHANISMS alone are not enough to protect \
these systems as a CRITICAL_DESIGN feature is SYSTEM_RESILIENCE, so \
INTRUSION_DETECTION and PREVENTION_SYSTEM are required. the \
PRACTICAL_CONSIDERATION for the implementation of the proposed schemes in \
practice is, however, neglected in the literature. this PAPER_ATTEMPTS to \
address this by generalising these considerations and using the lessons \
learned from WATER_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEMS as a CASE_STUDY. it was found \
that the considerations are similar irrespective of the \

Title: optimal sizing and energy management of a stand alone photovoltaic/pumped \
storage hydropower/BATTERY hybrid system using genetic algorithm for \
reducing cost and increasing reliability
Abstract:
```
in this paper, a genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the sizing of \
an autonomous renewable energy multi source system for reliable and \
economical supply of energy. the multi source system is composed of a \
photovoltaic generator, a pumped STORAGE_HYDROPOWER_SYSTEM and a BATTERY. \
the system will power public lighting and operate a garden fountain in \
the BOTANICAL_GARDEN, located in the ALEXANDRE_AIBEO_PARK in covilha \
(portugal). SOLAR_IRRADIANCE is initially simulated for a reference \
photovoltaic capacity (25 kwp) over one year by the pvsyst software for \
the city of covilha. two objective functions are used for sizing \
optimization: the loss of power supply probability (lpsp) and the \
levelized cost of energy (lce). the lce takes into account the \
CAPITAL_COST, the replacement cost and the cost of operation and \
maintenance. the genetic algorithm is used to determine the best \
configuration of the different subsystems (photovoltaic generator \
capacity, UPPER_WATER_RESERVOIR_CAPACITY and BATTERY_CAPACITY). the \
originality of this work lies in the combination of two STORAGE_ELEMENTS \
with different dynamics, the introduction of an adapted energy management \
strategy (ems) allowing to manage energy flows between the different \
subsystems and to control the process of CHARGING/ discharging \
STORAGE_ELEMENTS, and multi objective optimization (considering technical \
and economic criteria) of the sizing of the autonomous \
photovoltaic/pumped storage hydropower/ BATTERY hybrid system using \
genetic algorithm.  the author(s) 2022.

Title: SAFE_OPERATION_MANAGEMENT of URBAN_SMART_GRID based on DEEP_LEARNING
Abstract:
```
the SMART_GRID in the twenty first century is constantly innovated by the \
BIG_DATA_TECHNOLOGY and the INTERNET_OF_THINGS (iot) technology. as the \
second generation of a POWER_NETWORK, the SMART_GRID keeps developing \
towards automation and intelligence, driving the ENERGY_CONVERSION_RATE, \
POWER_UTILIZATION_RATE, and energy supply rate to increase. however, in \
the SMART_GRID, the POWER_TERMINAL has a PIVOTAL_ROLE in controlling, \
monitoring, and regulating the PRODUCTION_PROCESS of electricity, which \
is currently facing many security challenges. the most CRITICAL_ASPECT of \
SMART_GRID_SECURITY_MANAGEMENT is to ensure the security of \
POWER_TERMINALS. existing solutions generally \
MONITOR_POWER_TERMINAL_DEVICES by monitoring POWER_TERMINAL_TRAFFIC; \
however, SUCH_SECURITY_POLICIES can only MONITOR_ATTACKS with \
CHARACTERIZATION_PROPERTIES at the TRAFFIC_LEVEL and cannot be used to \
MONITOR_POWER_TERMINAL_DEVICES directly. based on this, this paper \
reviewed the literature on INTELLIGENT_OPERATION and MAINTENANCE and \
DEEP_LEARNING at home and abroad and comprehensively analyzed the \
RESEARCH_PROGRESS of INTELLIGENT_OPERATION and MAINTENANCE, and in the \
COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS of DEEP_LEARNING_METHODS, because the \
CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK has fewer connections and parameters and can \
control the capacity by controlling its depth and width, it is convenient \
to establish a model with larger LEARNING_CAPACITY, so a \
CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK is chosen for DATA_ANALYSIS. in this study, \
we choose to use the CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK to analyze the data, \
combine the monitoring, management, and FAULT_LOCATION of operation and \
MAINTENANCE_WORK organically through some DEEP_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS, \
reduce the number of MODEL_LAYERS through a DEEP_LEARNING based security \
monitoring technology for ELECTRIC_POWER_TERMINALS to improve the \
training speed and efficiency, and achieve all round protection for \
ELECTRIC_POWER_TERMINALS at the DEVICE_LEVEL and the NETWORK_LEVEL. the \
management of URBAN_SMART_GRID dispatching operation also requires \
STRICT_IMPLEMENTATION of relevant TECHNICAL_STANDARDS to ensure the \
standardized operation and enhance the safety and stability of \
GRID_OPERATION.   2022 huimin you.

Title: minimizing ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and SLA_VIOLATION in FOG_COMPUTING using \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK
Abstract:
```
with the FAST_DEVELOPMENT of cloud computing methods, EXPONENTIAL_GROWTH \
is faced by several users. it is complicated for TRADITIONAL_DATA_CENTERS \
to perform several jobs in real time because of \
INADEQUATE_BANDWIDTH_RESOURCES. therefore, the method of FOG_COMPUTING is \
recommended for supporting and providing fast CLOUD_SERVICES. it is not a \
substitute but is a POWERFUL_COMPLEMENT to cloud computing. the reduction \
of ENERGY_CONSUMPTION through the notion of FOG_COMPUTING has certainly \
been a challenge for CURRENT_RESEARCHERS, industries, and communities. \
VARIOUS_INDUSTRIES, including finance and healthcare, require a rich \
resource based platform for processing LARGE_AMOUNTS of data with cloud \
computing across FOG_ARCHITECTURE. the consumption of energy across \
FOG_SERVERS_RELIES on allocating techniques for services (USER_REQUESTS). \
it FACILITATES_PROCESSING at the edge with the probability of interacting \
with the cloud. this article proposed energy aware scheduling by using \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and modified \
MULTIOBJECTIVE_JOB_SCHEDULING (mmjs) techniques. the emphasis of the work \
is on the reduction of ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_RATE with less \
SERVICE_LEVEL_AGREEMENT (sla) violation in FOG_COMPUTING for \
DATA_CENTERS. the RESULT_SHOWS that there is a 3.9% reduction in \
SLA_VIOLATION when a MULTIOBJECTIVE_FUNCTION with \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK is applied.  2020 BENTHAM_SCIENCE_PUBLISHERS.

Title: a multi agent system for ENERGY_MANAGEMENT of HYBRID_POWER_SYSTEM;
Abstract:
```
the field of ENERGY_MANAGEMENT is an area increasingly studied. however, \
most solutions are based on centralized systems and barely \
FULFIL_CRITERION like FAULT_TOLERANCE or adaptability. that is why a \
distributed MANAGEMENT_SOLUTION based on the paradigm of \
MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS (mas) is proposed in this paper. in addition to a \
more NATURAL_CONCEPTION, based on a bottom up approach, this \
SOLUTION_ENSURES better SYSTEM_RELIABILITY. after reviewing the \
PREVIOUS_WORKS, an application of mas to POWER_MANAGEMENT in a \
HYBRID_POWER_SOURCE is presented. the principle is validated using a \
SIMULATION_MODEL and is then experimented with a REAL_HYBRID_SYSTEM. the \
results show that this approach is perfectly valid and can respond to \
most problems of centralized ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS.  2009 lavoisier, \

Abstract:
```
initiatives to MINIMISE_BATTERY_USE, ADDRESS_SUSTAINABILITY, and reduce \
REGULAR_MAINTENANCE have driven the challenge to use \
ALTERNATIVE_POWER_SOURCES to supply ENERGY to devices deployed in \
INTERNET_OF_THINGS (iot) networks. as a KEY_PILLAR of fifth generation \
(5g) and beyond 5g networks,iot is estimated to reach 42 billion devices \
by the year 2025. THERMOELECTRIC_GENERATORS (tegs) are \
SOLID_STATE_ENERGY_HARVESTERS which reliably and renewably convert \
THERMAL_ENERGY into ELECTRICAL_ENERGY. these devices are able to recover \
lost THERMAL_ENERGY, produce ENERGY in EXTREME_ENVIRONMENTS, generate \
ELECTRIC_POWER in REMOTE_AREAS, and power micro SENSORS. applying the \
STATE_OF_THE_ART, the authorspresent a COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of \
MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) approaches applied in combination with teg powered \
IOT_DEVICES to manage and predict AVAILABLE_ENERGY. the APPLICATION_AREAS \
of teg driven IOT_DEVICES that exploit as a HEAT_SOURCE the \
TEMPERATURE_DIFFERENCES found in the environment, BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURES, \
machines, and other technologies are summarised. based on detailed \
research of the STATE_OF_THE_ART in teg powered devices, the authors \
investigated the research challenges, applied algorithms and \
APPLICATION_AREAS of this technology. the aims of the research were to \
devise NEW_ENERGY_PREDICTION and ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS based on \
ML_METHODS, create supervised algorithms which better estimate incoming \
ENERGY, and develop unsupervised and semi supervised approaches which \
provide adaptive and DYNAMIC_OPERATION. the REVIEW_RESULTS indicate that \
tegs are a SUITABLE_ENERGY_HARVESTING_TECHNOLOGY for low power \
applications through their scalability, usability in \
UBIQUITOUS_TEMPERATURE_DIFFERENCE_SCENARIOS, and long operating lifetime. \
however, tegs also have LOW_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY (around 10%) and require a \

with the rise in electricity, gas and oil prices and the persistently \

EFFECTIVE_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT in ENERGY_SYSTEMS, including \
ELECTRICAL_GRIDS. recent literature exhibits large potential for \
optimizing the behavior of SUCH_SYSTEMS towards ENERGY_PERFORMANCE, \
reducing peak loads and exploiting environmentally FRIENDLY_WAYS for \
ENERGY_PRODUCTION. however, the primary challenge relies on the \
optimization of SUCH_SYSTEMS, which introduces SIGNIFICANT_COMPLEXITIES \
since they present quite DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR. SUCH_CYBERPHYSICAL_FRAMEWORKS \
usually integrate multiple interconnected components such as power \
plants, TRANSMISSION_LINES, DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS and VARIOUS_TYPES of \
energy storage systems, while the behavior of these components is \
affected by VARIOUS_EXTERNAL_FACTORS such as user individual \
requirements, WEATHER_CONDITIONS, ENERGY_DEMAND and market prices. \
consequently, TRADITIONAL_OPTIMAL_CONTROL_APPROACHESSUCH as rule based \
control (rbc)prove inadequate to deal with the DIVERSE_DYNAMICS which \
define the behavior of such complicated frameworks. moreover, even \
SOPHISTICATED_TECHNIQUESSUCH as model predictive control (mpc)showcase \
model related limitations that hinder the applicability of an optimal \
control scheme. to this end, ai model free techniques such as \
reinforcement learning (rl) offer a FRUITFUL_POTENTIAL for embedding \

present promising results in VARIOUS_FIELDS of engineering, indicating \
that RL_FRAMEWORKS may prove the key element for delivering \
