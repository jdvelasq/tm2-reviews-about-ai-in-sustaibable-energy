AB FORECASTING the OUTPUT_POWER of SOLAR_SYSTEMS is required for the
   GOOD_OPERATION of the POWER_GRID or for the OPTIMAL_MANAGEMENT of the
   ENERGY_FLUXES occurring into the SOLAR_SYSTEM. before FORECASTING the
   SOLAR_SYSTEMS_OUTPUT, it is essential to focus the prediction on the
   SOLAR_IRRADIANCE. the GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION FORECASTING can be performed by
   several methods; the two BIG_CATEGORIES are the CLOUD_IMAGERY combined with
   PHYSICAL_MODELS, and the MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS. in this context, the
   objective of this paper is to give an overview of FORECASTING methods of
   SOLAR_IRRADIATION using MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES. although, a lot of
   papers describes methodologies like NEURAL_NETWORKS or
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_REGRESSION, it will be shown that other methods
   (REGRESSION_TREE, RANDOM_FOREST, gradient boosting and many others) begin to
   be used in this context of prediction.  the performance ranking of
   SUCH_METHODS is complicated due to the diversity of the DATA_SET, TIME_STEP,
   FORECASTING horizon, set up and PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS. overall, the error
   of prediction is quite equivalent.  to improve the PREDICTION_PERFORMANCE
   some authors proposed the use of HYBRID_MODELS or to use an ensemble
   forecast approach.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

   is to review ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) based techniques in order to
   identify SUITABLE_METHODS available in the literature for

   that ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_TECHNIQUES predict SOLAR_RADIATION more
   accurately in comparison to CONVENTIONAL_METHODS. the PREDICTION_ACCURACY of
   ANN_MODELS is found to be dependent on INPUT_PARAMETER_COMBINATIONS,

PY 2011
AB this paper presents the RESEARCH_RESULTS of a comparison of three
   DIFFERENT_MODEL based approaches for WIND_TURBINE FAULT_DETECTION in
   ONLINE_SCADA_DATA, by applying developed models to five real measured faults
   and anomalies.  the REGRESSION_BASED_MODEL as the simplest approach to build
   a NORMAL_BEHAVIOR_MODEL is compared to two ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK based
   approaches, which are a FULL_SIGNAL_RECONSTRUCTION and an autoregressive
   NORMAL_BEHAVIOR_MODEL. based on a REAL_TIME_SERIES containing two generator
   bearing damages the capabilities of identifying the INCIPIENT_FAULT prior to
   the ACTUAL_FAILURE are investigated.  the period after the first
   BEARING_DAMAGE is used to develop the three NORMAL_BEHAVIOR_MODELS. the
   developed or trained models are used to investigate how the second
   DAMAGE_MANIFESTS in the PREDICTION_ERROR. furthermore the
   FULL_SIGNAL_RECONSTRUCTION and the AUTOREGRESSIVE_APPROACH are applied to
   further REAL_TIME_SERIES containing gearbox bearing damages and
   STATOR_TEMPERATURE_ANOMALIES. the comparison revealed all THREE_MODELS being
   capable of detecting INCIPIENT_FAULTS. however, they differ in the effort
   required for MODEL_DEVELOPMENT and the remaining OPERATIONAL_TIME after
   first indication of damage.  the
   GENERAL_NONLINEAR_NEURAL_NETWORK_APPROACHES_OUTPERFORM the REGRESSION_MODEL.
   the remaining SEASONALITY in the REGRESSION_MODEL_PREDICTION_ERROR makes it
   difficult to DETECT_ABNORMALITY and leads to increased ALARM_LEVELS and thus
   a shorter remaining OPERATIONAL_PERIOD. for the bearing damages and the
   STATOR_ANOMALIES under investigation the
   FULL_SIGNAL_RECONSTRUCTION_NEURAL_NETWORK gave the best FAULT_VISIBILITY and
   thus led to the highest CONFIDENCE_LEVEL.  2010 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights

   DIFFERENT_CITIES of india.  in order to check the PREDICTION_ACCURACY using
   the identified parameters, three ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) models are
   developed (ann 1, ann 2 and ann 3). the MAXIMUM_MAPE for ann 1, ann 2 and
   ann 3 models are found to be 20.12%, 6.89% and 9.04% respectively, showing
   13.23% improved PREDICTION_ACCURACY of the ann 2 model which
   UTILIZES_TEMPERATURE, MAXIMUM_TEMPERATURE, MINIMUM_TEMPERATURE, height above

   VARIOUS_SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION_METHODS have been used.
   PREDICTIVE_DATA_MINING offers variety of methods for
   SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTIONS where ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK is one of the
   reliable and ACCURATE_METHODS. a SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW of literature was
   conducted and identified 24 papers that discuss ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK
   for SOLAR_SYSTEMS_DESIGN and SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION. the
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_TECHNIQUES were employed for designing
   SOLAR_SYSTEMS and predicting SOLAR_RADIATIONS to assess CURRENT_LITERATURE
   on the basis of PREDICTION_ACCURACY and inadequacies.  SPECIFIC_INCLUSION
   and EXCLUSION_CRITERIA in two DISTINCT_ROUNDS were applied to determine the
   most RELEVANT_STUDIES for our RESEARCH_GOAL. further, it is observed from
   the result of this study that ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK gives GOOD_ACCURACY
   in terms of PREDICTION_ERROR less than 20%. the accuracy of
   SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION_MODELS is found to be dependent on

PY 2009
AB PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY has nowadays an increased importance in
   ELECTRICAL_POWER_APPLICATIONS, since it is considered as an essentially
   inexhaustible and broadly AVAILABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCE. however, the
   OUTPUT_POWER provided via the PHOTOVOLTAIC_CONVERSION_PROCESS depends on
   SOLAR_IRRADIATION and temperature.  therefore, to maximize the efficiency of
   the PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_SYSTEM, it is necessary to track the
   MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT of the PV_ARRAY. the PRESENT_PAPER proposes a
   MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT_TRACKER (mppt) method, based on FUZZY_LOGIC_CONTROLLER
   (flc), applied to a STAND_ALONE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM. it uses a sampling
   measure of the PV_ARRAY_POWER and voltage then determines an
   OPTIMAL_INCREMENT required to have the optimal OPERATING_VOLTAGE which
   permits MAXIMUM_POWER_TRACKING. this method carries HIGH_ACCURACY around the
   OPTIMUM_POINT when compared to the conventional one.  the
   STAND_ALONE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM used in this paper includes two bi
   directional dc/dc converters and a lead acid battery bank to overcome the
   SCARE_PERIODS. one converter works as an MPP_TRACKER, while the other
   regulates the BATTERIES_STATE of charge and compensates the POWER_DEFICIT to
   provide a CONTINUOUS_DELIVERY of energy to the load.  the obtained
   SIMULATION_RESULTS show the effectiveness of the proposed
   FUZZY_LOGIC_CONTROLLER.  2009 elsevier b.v.  all rights reserved.

AB most discoveries in MATERIALS_SCIENCE have been made empirically, typically
   through ONE_VARIABLE_AT_A_TIME (edisonian) experimentation.  the
   characteristics of materials based systems are, however, neither simple nor
   uncorrelated.  in a device such as an ORGANIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC, for example, the
   level of complexity is high due to the SHEER_NUMBER of components and
   PROCESSING_CONDITIONS, and thus, changing one variable can have
   MULTIPLE_UNFORESEEN effects due to their INTERCONNECTIVITY.
   DESIGN_OF_EXPERIMENTS (doe) is ideally suited for
   SUCH_MULTIVARIABLE_ANALYSES: by planning one's experiments as per the
   principles of doe, one can test and optimize SEVERAL_VARIABLES
   simultaneously, thus accelerating the process of discovery and optimization
   while saving time and PRECIOUS_LABORATORY_RESOURCES. when combined with
   MACHINE_LEARNING, the consideration of one's data in this manner provides a
   DIFFERENT_PERSPECTIVE for optimization and discovery, akin to CLIMBING out
   of a NARROW_VALLEY of serial (ONE_VARIABLE_AT_A_TIME) experimentation, to a

PY 2013
AB in RECENT_YEARS, introduction of an ALTERNATIVE_ENERGY_SOURCE such as
   SOLAR_ENERGY is expected.  however, insolation is not constant and the
   output of a photovoltaic (pv) system is influenced by
   METEOROLOGICAL_CONDITIONS. in order to predict the POWER_OUTPUT for
   PV_SYSTEMS as accurately as possible, an INSOLATION_ESTIMATION_METHOD is
   required.  this paper proposes the POWER_OUTPUT forecasting of a PV_SYSTEM
   based on insolation forecasting at 24 hours ahead by using
   WEATHER_REPORTED_DATA, FUZZY_THEORY, and NEURAL_NETWORK (nn). if the
   SUITABLE_TRAINING_DATA is not selected, the training process of nn tends to
   be unstable.  the proposed technique for application of nn is trained by
   POWER_OUTPUT_DATA based on FUZZY_THEORY and WEATHER_REPORTED_DATA. since the
   FUZZY_MODEL_DETERMINES the insolation forecast data, nn will train the
   POWER_OUTPUT smoothly.  the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by
   comparing the forecasting abilities on the COMPUTER_SIMULATIONS.  2010 2012

AB among the DIFFERENT_FORMS of CLEAN_ENERGIES, solar energy has attracted a
   lot of attention because it is not only sustainable, but also is renewable
   and this means that we will never run out of it but the potential of using
   this form of renewable energy depends on its accessibility.  due to the fact
   that the number of meteorological stations where GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION
   (gsr) is recorded, is limited in iran we were meant to develop four
   DISTINCTIVE_MODELS based on ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in order to
   prognosticate gsr in TEHRAN_PROVINCE, iran.  accordingly, the polynomial and
   radial basis function (rbf) are applied as the kernel function of support
   vector regression (svr) and input energies from
   DIFFERENT_METEOROLOGICAL_DATA obtained from the only station in the studied
   region were selected as the inputs of the model and the gsr was chosen as
   the output of the models.  instead of minimizing the observed
   TRAINING_ERROR, svr poly and svr rbf attempt to minimize the
   GENERALIZATION_ERROR bound so as to achieve generalized performance.  the
   EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS show that an improvement in predictive accuracy and
   capability of generalization can be achieved by the proposed approach.  the
   calculated root mean square error and CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT disclosed that
   svr  rbf performed well in predicting gsr.  comparing svr rbf results with
   svr poly, anfis, and ANN_REVEALS that svr rbf outperforms the poly model in
   terms of prediction accuracy.  2014 ELSEVIER_LTD.

TI ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE based maximum power point tracking controllers for

AU Kermadi M; Berkouk EM
TC 128
SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY 2017
AB in photovoltaic (pv) systems, maximum power point tracking (mppt) is an
   indispensable task.  to date, VARIOUS_MPPT_TECHNIQUES have been proposed in
   the literature using classical and ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_METHODS. however,
   those techniques are tested on different pv systems and under different
   environmental conditions.  in this work, we attempt to summarize and to give
   a comprehensive comparative study of the most adopted
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) based mppt techniques.  the mppt techniques
   which will be described are based on: proportional integral derivative
   (pid), fuzzy logic (fl), ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann), genetic algorithms
   (ga) and particle SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso). the developed mppt controllers
   are tested under the same WEATHER_PROFILE in the same PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM
   which is composed of a PV_MODULE, a dc dc buck boost converter and a dc
   load.  initially, modelling and simulation of the system is performed using
   the matlab/simulink environment.  thereafter, the SLIDING_MODE_CONTROL is
   applied to the converter in order to improve its performance.  in a further
   stage, the different steps of development for each mppt technique are
   presented.  simulation is performed to confirm the validity of the proposed
   controllers under the same VARIABLE_TEMPERATURE and
   SOLAR_IRRADIANCE_CONDITIONS. finally, a comparative study is carried out in
   order to evaluate the developed techniques regarding two PRINCIPAL_CRITERIA:
   the performance and the implementation cost.  the performance is evaluated
   using comparative analysis of the tracking speed, the average tracking
   error, the variance and the efficiency.  to estimate the implementation
   cost, a classification is carried out according to the type of the used
   sensors, the type of circuitry and the SOFTWARE_LEVEL_COMPLEXITY.
   recommendations that expected to be useful for researchers in the mppt area
   about the validity of each mppt technique are given in the last section.

PY 2015
AB in this paper, the EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE (elm) is employed to predict
   HORIZONTAL_GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION (hgsr). for this purpose, the capability
   of developed ELM_METHOD is appraised statistically for PREDICTION of monthly
   mean daily hgsr using three DIFFERENT_TYPES of INPUT_PARAMETERS: (1)
   sunshine duration based (sdb), (2) difference temperature based (tb) and (3)
   MULTIPLE_PARAMETERS based (mpb). the long term measured data sets collected
   for city of shiraz situated in the FARS_PROVINCE of iran have been utilized
   as a CASE_STUDY. the predicted hgsr via elm is compared with those of
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE (svm), GENETIC_PROGRAMMING (gp) and
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) to ensure the precision of elm.  it is found
   that higher accuracy can be obtained by MULTIPLE_PARAMETERS based estimation
   of hgsr using all techniques.  the COMPUTATIONAL_RESULTS prove that elm is
   highly accurate and reliable and shows higher performance than svm, gp and
   ann.  for MULTIPLE_PARAMETERS based ELM_MODEL, the mean
   ABSOLUTE_PERCENTAGE_ERROR, mean ABSOLUTE_BIAS_ERROR, root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR,
   RELATIVE_ROOT MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR and coefficient of determination are
   obtained as 2.2518%, 0.4343 mj/m2, 0.5882 mj/m2, 2.9757% and 0.9865,
   respectively.  by conducting a further verification, it is found that the
   ELM_METHOD also offers HIGH_SUPERIORITY over four EMPIRICAL_MODELS
   established for this study and an INTELLIGENT_MODEL from the literature.  in
   the FINAL_ANALYSIS, a PROPER_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS is performed to identify
   the influence of considered INPUT_ELEMENTS on HGSR_PREDICTION in which the
   results reveal the significance of APPROPRIATE_SELECTION of INPUT_PARAMETERS
   to boost the accuracy of HGSR_PREDICTION by the ELM_ALGORITHM. in a
   nutshell, the COMPARATIVE_RESULTS clearly specify that ELM_TECHNIQUE can

AB SOLAR_ENERGY is one of the most IMPORTANT_FACTORS used in the development of
   the countries.  since it is a RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCE, it reduces the demand
   on the NON_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES such as FOSSIL_FUELS, oil, NATURAL_GAS,
   nuclear, and other sources.  therefore, many researchers have sought to
   improve the performance of SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS via applying several
   METAHEURISTIC_METHODS such as PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso) which
   simulates the behavior of the FISH_SCHOOLS or BIRD_FLOCKS. pso has been used
   in DIFFERENT_APPLICATIONS including engineering, manufacturing, and
   medicine.  the MAIN_PROCESS of the pso is to determine the OPTIMAL_POSITION
   for each particle inside the population.  this is performed through updating
   the position using the velocity of each particle and the SHARED_INFORMATION
   between the particles.  the aim of this paper is to provide a review on the
   PSOS_APPLICATIONS to improve the performance of SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS and to
   identify the RESEARCH_GAP for FUTURE_WORK. the LITERATURE_REVIEW used in
   this study indicates that the pso is a very PROMISING_METHOD to enhance the

AB the micro siting of wind farms has recently attracted much attention due to

   ELECTRICAL_POWER extracted from a WIND_FARM while satisfying the required
   distance between TURBINES for OPERATION_SAFETY. the micro siting problem is
   by nature a CONSTRAINED_OPTIMIZATION problem, in which the coupling of wake
   effects is strong and the number of POSITION_CONSTRAINTS between TURBINES is
   large.  an improved GAUSSIAN_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM is
   proposed to optimize the positions of TURBINES in the CONTINUOUS_SPACE. to
   prevent the premature of the ALGORITHM, a LOCAL_SEARCH_STRATEGY based on

   achieved by the PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION. a simple feasibility based
   method is employed to compare the performance of DIFFERENT_SCHEMES.

   DIVERSE_ENERGY supply market.  however, SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC which is a type

   SHORT_DURATION only.  next, its output is intermittent and randomness.  in
   addition, it CHANGES_BEHAVIOR of POWER_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM from

   POWER_QUALITY_EVENTS are urged to be mitigated to further explore the

AB PRECISE_MODEL_PARAMETERS being the prerequisite for realizing
   ACCURATE_PV_MODELS, PARAMETER_IDENTIFICATION_TECHNIQUES have gained
   IMMENSE_INTEREST over the years among the researchers specializing in
   PV_SYSTEMS. the application of VARIOUS_PROMISING_METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS to
   optimize the MODEL_PARAMETERS have lightened up the scope of further
   enhancements in this field.  ever since, NUMEROUS_METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS
   have deployed for this purpose.  with handful of techniques available in
   this regard, this paper takes up an initiative to review the existing
   METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS based PARAMETER_EXTRACTION_TECHNIQUES with an
   emphasis on their compatibility, accuracy, CONVERGENCE_SPEED, range of
   parameters set and their validating environment.  based on the analysis
   conducted, ACCURATE_MODELS available for 17 different industrial
   SOLAR_CELLS/modules are identified.  inspired by this review, an
   unidentified gateway between PARAMETER_EXTRACTION and FAULT_DETECTION in
   PV_SYSTEMS have been identified; and has further extended this review to
   differentiate some models that can help the researchers to achieve accurate,
   efficient and RAPID_FAULT_DETECTION. this review is a VALUABLE_GATHERING of

AB this PAPER_FOCUSES on FEATURE_SELECTION_PROBLEMS that arise in
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS. FEATURE_SELECTION is an IMPORTANT_PROBLEM in
   MACHINE_LEARNING, both in classification and REGRESSION_PROBLEMS. in
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS, FEATURE_SELECTION appears related to
   PREDICTION_SYSTEMS in the most IMPORTANT_SOURCES such as WIND, solar and
   MARINE_RESOURCES. the objective of the paper is twofold: first, a review of
   the most IMPORTANT_PREDICTION_SYSTEMS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS
   involving FEATURE_SELECTION is carried out.  analysis and discussion of
   different FEATURE_SELECTION_PROBLEMS in PREDICTION_SYSTEMS are considered.
   we show that WRAPPER_FSP_APPROACHES are those mostly used due to their
   higher performance.  they include a diversity of algorithms, prevailing fast
   training approaches.  the lack of an UNIFORM_FRAMEWORK for fsp and the
   diversity of tackled PROBLEMS_IMPEDE a SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT of the
   performance and properties of the applied methods.  thus, the simultaneously
   use of several GLOBAL_SEARCH_MECHANISMS should be the preferred option.  in
   a second part of the paper, we explore this possibility, by introducing a
   NOVEL_APPROACH for FEATURE_SELECTION based on a novel meta heuristic, the
   CORAL_REEFS_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM with SUBSTRATE_LAYER. this approach is
   able to combine DIFFERENT_SEARCH_MECHANISMS into a single algorithm,
   providing a GLOBAL_SEARCH_PROCEDURE of HIGH_QUALITY. we use an
   EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE for prediction within this NOVEL_APPROACH. the
   performance of the system is evaluated in a problem of WIND SPEED_PREDICTION
   from NUMERICAL_MODELS_INPUT, using real data from a WIND_FARM in spain,
   where comparison with ALTERNATIVE_REGRESSION_ALGORITHMS is carried out.

AB DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION is a FUNDAMENTAL_PARAMETER highly required in
   several SOLAR_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS. despite its significance,
   DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION is not measured in many locations around the world
   due to technical and FISCAL_LIMITATIONS. on this account, determining the
   amount of DIFFUSE_RADIATION alternatively based upon precise and reliable
   estimating methods is indeed essential.  in this paper, a coupled model is
   developed for estimating daily HORIZONTAL_DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION by
   integrating the SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE (svm) with WAVELET_TRANSFORM (wt)
   algorithm.  to test the validity of the coupled svm wt method, daily
   measured global and DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION_DATA sets for city of kerman
   situated in a SUNNY_PART of iran are utilized.  for the developed svm wt
   model, DIFFUSE_FRACTION (CLOUDINESS_INDEX) is correlated with
   CLEARNESS_INDEX as the only INPUT_PARAMETER. the suitability of svm wt is
   evaluated against RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_SVM (svm rbf),
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and a 3rd DEGREE_EMPIRICAL_MODEL established
   for this study.  it is found that the estimated
   DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION_VALUES by the svm wt model are in
   FAVOURABLE_AGREEMENTS with measured data.  according to the conducted
   STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS, the obtained mean ABSOLUTE_BIAS_ERROR, root
   MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR and CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT are 0.5757 mj/m2, 0.6940 mj/m2
   and 0.9631, respectively.  while for the svm rbf ranked next the attained
   values are 1.0877 mj/m2, 1.2583 mj/m2 and 0.8599, respectively.  in fact,
   the STUDY_RESULTS indicate that svm wt is an EFFICIENT_METHOD which enjoys
   much higher precision than other models, especially the 3rd
   DEGREE_EMPIRICAL_MODEL.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

   SOLAR_IRRADIANCE makes many existing statistical and
   MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES less competent in providing
   ACCURATE_PREDICTIONS. in this context, DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS have been
   proposed by several researchers to reduce the limitations of existing
   MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS and improve PREDICTION_ACCURACY. in this work, an
   extensive and COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of DEEP_LEARNING based SOLAR_IRRADIANCE
   FORECASTING models is presented.  the effectiveness and efficacy of several
   DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS, including LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY, DEEP_BELIEF_NETWORK,
   ECHO_STATE_NETWORK, CONVOLUTION_NEURAL_NETWORK, etc.  have been reviewed.
   the results obtained in the reported studies proved the superiority of
   DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS in solar FORECASTING applications.  few researchers

   a PROMISING_SOLUTION for FUTURE_GENERATION_SYSTEMS. a combination of these
   sources with an optimized configuration can face the CLIMATE_CHANGE
   obstacles, permit better reliability, and reduce the cost of the generated

   algorithm for an optimized design of GRID_DEPENDENT hybrid photovoltaic wind
   ENERGY systems.  this ALGORITHM_USES the actual hourly data of wind speeds,
   SOLAR_RADIATION, temperature, and ELECTRICITY_DEMAND in a CERTAIN_LOCATION.
   the PSO_ALGORITHM is employed to obtain the MINIMUM_COST of the generated
   ENERGY while matching the electricity supply with the LOCAL_DEMAND with
   PARTICULAR_RELIABILITY_INDEX. the algorithm has been tested by considering a
   REAL_CASE_STUDY used the ACTUAL_SITUATION to supply the ELECTRICITY_DEMAND
   from UTILITY_GRID at ELECTRICITY_MARKET_PRICES to estimate how significant
   are the cost saving compared to the ACTUAL_SITUATION_COSTS. results showed

   PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS are subject to DIFFERENT_TYPES of faults and failures,
   while AVAILABLE_FAULT_DETECTION_EQUIPMENT are mainly used to protect and
   isolate the PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS from some faults (such as ARC_FAULT, line to

AB WIND_ENERGY farms are moving into deeper and more REMOTE_WATERS to benefit
   from availability of more space for the installation of WIND_TURBINES as
   well as higher WIND speed for the production of electricity.  WIND farm
   asset managers must ensure availability of ADEQUATE_POWER supply as well as
   RELIABILITY of WIND_TURBINES throughout their lifetime.  the environmental
   conditions in deep waters often change very rapidly, and therefore the
   PERFORMANCE_METRICS used in different life cycle phases of a
   WIND_ENERGY_PROJECT will need to be updated on a frequent basis so as to
   ensure that the WIND_ENERGY_SYSTEMS operate at the highest RELIABILITY. for
   this reason, there is a crucial need for the WIND_ENERGY_INDUSTRY to adopt
   advanced computational tools/techniques that are capable of modelling the
   RISK_SCENARIOS in near real time as well as providing a prompt response to
   any emergency situation.  BAYESIAN_NETWORK (bn) is a
   POPULAR_PROBABILISTIC_METHOD that can be used for SYSTEM_RELIABILITY
   modelling and decision making under uncertainty.  this paper provides a
   SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW and evaluation of existing research on the use of bn
   models in the WIND_ENERGY_SECTOR. to conduct this literature review, all
   RELEVANT_DATABASES from inception to date were searched, and a total of 70
   sources (including journal publications, conference proceedings,
   PHD_DISSERTATIONS, industry reports, best PRACTICE_DOCUMENTS and
   SOFTWARE_USER_GUIDES) which met the inclusion criteria were identified.  our
   REVIEW_FINDINGS reveal that the applications of bns in the
   WIND_ENERGY_INDUSTRY are quite diverse, ranging from WIND_POWER and
   WEATHER_FORECASTING to RISK_MANAGEMENT, fault diagnosis and prognosis,
   STRUCTURAL_ANALYSIS, RELIABILITY_ASSESSMENT, and maintenance planning and
   updating.  furthermore, a number of case studies are presented to illustrate
   the applicability of bns in practice.  although the
   PAPER_DETAILS_INFORMATION applicable to the WIND_ENERGY_INDUSTRY, the
   knowledge gained can be transferred to many other sectors.  2020 elsevier

AB CONCENTRATOR_PHOTOVOLTAICS (cpv) is considered to be one of the most
   PROMISING_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_COMPONENTS that could lead to a reduction on the
   dependence on FOSSIL_FUELS. the aim of CPV_TECHNOLOGY is to lower the cost
   of the system by reducing the SEMICONDUCTOR_MATERIAL, and replacing it by
   CHEAP_OPTICAL_DEVICES that concentrate the light received from the sun on a
   small size solar cell.  the ELECTRICAL_CHARACTERIZATION of devices based on
   this technology however, is inherently different and more complex than that
   of the TRADITIONAL_PV_DEVICES. due to the advantages offered by the
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURON_NETWORKS (anns) to solve complex and non linear problems,
   and the GREAT_LEVEL of complexity of electrical modelling of CPV_DEVICES, in
   RECENT_YEARS, several authors have applied a variety of anns to solve issues
   related to CPV_TECHNOLOGY. in this paper, a review of the anns developed to
   address VARIOUS_TOPICS related with both, low and
   HIGH_CONCENTRATOR_PHOTOVOLTAICS, is presented.  moreover, a review of the
   ann based models to predict the MAIN_ENVIRONMENTAL_PARAMETERS that affect
   the performance of CPV_SYSTEMS operating outdoors is also provided.

AB recently, with ENERGY_CRISES and ENVIRONMENTAL_PROBLEMS becoming
   increasingly obvious, the utilization of WIND_POWER has become a
   BIG_CONCERN. meanwhile, the INCONSISTENT_RELATIONSHIP between china's
   economy and wind ENERGY_POTENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION has caused
   INEVITABLE_DIFFICULTIES in transportation of WIND_POWER and even in
   GRID_INTEGRATION. therefore, the establishment of ELECTRICAL_POWER_SYSTEM

   LOGNORMAL_PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTIONS are evaluated.  then three
   NUMERICAL_METHODS (nms)   method of moment (mm),
   MAXIMUM_LIKELIHOOD_ESTIMATION (mle), and least SQUARES_METHOD (lsm), are
   applied to get PARAMETER_ESTIMATION in the these distributions.
   additionally, another three COMPARISON_METAHEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS
   (moas), including BAT_ALGORITHM (BA), CUCKOO_SEARCH_ALGORITHM (CS) and
   PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (PSO) are employed as COMPARISON_METHODS to tune

   perform better than nms.  moreover, BA weibull, CS weibull, and PSO weibull
   with only a SLIGHT_DIFFERENCE_OUTPERFORM all of the other distributions.
   specifically, BA weibull and PSO weibull are only slightly superior to CS
   weibull.  the AVERAGE_WIND_POWER_DENSITY, the EFFECTIVE_WIND_POWER_DENSITY,
   the AVAILABLE_FACTOR and the CAPACITY_FACTOR of wind turbine are considered
   as KEY_DETERMINANT_FACTORS in assessing the LOW_SPEED wind ENERGY_POTENTIAL,

   and EVOLUTIONARY_COMPUTATION). this PAPER_REVIEWS those used in
   WAVE_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS, both in the RESOURCE_ESTIMATION and in the design
   and control of WAVE_ENERGY_CONVERTERS. in particular, most of the

AB SOLAR_POWER_FORECASTING will have a SIGNIFICANT_IMPACT on the future of
   large scale RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PLANTS. predicting
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION depends heavily on CLIMATE_CONDITIONS, which
   fluctuate over time.  in this research, we propose a HYBRID_MODEL that
   combines MACHINE_LEARNING methods with theta STATISTICAL_METHOD for more
   ACCURATE_PREDICTION of FUTURE_SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION from
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PLANTS. the MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS include long short term
   memory (lstm), GATE_RECURRENT_UNIT (gru), AUTOENCODER_LSTM (auto lstm) and a
   newly proposed auto gru.  to enhance the accuracy of the proposed
   MACHINE_LEARNING and STATISTICAL_HYBRID_MODEL (mlshm), we employ two
   DIVERSITY_TECHNIQUES, i.e.  STRUCTURAL_DIVERSITY and DATA_DIVERSITY. to
   combine the prediction of the ENSEMBLE_MEMBERS in the proposed mlshm, we
   exploit four combining methods: simple averaging approach, weighted
   averaging using LINEAR_APPROACH and using non LINEAR_APPROACH, and
   combination through variance using INVERSE_APPROACH. the proposed
   MLSHM_SCHEME was validated on two real time series datasets, that
   SRE_SHAGAYA in kuwait and cocoa in the usa.  the experiments show that the
   proposed mlshm, using all the COMBINATION_METHODS, achieved higher accuracy
   compared to the prediction of the TRADITIONAL_INDIVIDUAL_MODELS. results
   demonstrate that a HYBRID_MODEL combining MACHINE_LEARNING methods with
   STATISTICAL_METHOD outperformed a HYBRID_MODEL that only combines
   MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS without STATISTICAL_METHOD.  2019

AB the use of PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS for CLEAN_ELECTRICAL_ENERGY has increased.
   however, due to their LOW_EFFICIENCY, researchers have looked for ways to
   increase their effectiveness and improve their efficiency.  the
   MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT_TRACKING (mppt) inverters allow us to maximize the
   extraction of as much energy as possible from PV_PANELS, and they require
   algorithms to extract the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT (mpp). several
   INTELLIGENT_ALGORITHMS show ACCEPTABLE_PERFORMANCE; however, few consider
   using ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (ann). these have the advantage of giving a
   fast and accurate tracking of the mpp.  the CONTROLLER_EFFECTIVENESS depends
   on the algorithm used in the hidden layer and how well the NEURAL_NETWORK
   has been trained.  articles over the last six years were studied.  a review
   of DIFFERENT_PAPERS, reports, and other documents using ann for MPPT_CONTROL
   is presented.  the algorithms are based on ann or in a HYBRID_COMBINATION
   with fl or a METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHM. ANN_MPPT_ALGORITHMS deliver an
   AVERAGE_PERFORMANCE of 98% in UNIFORM_CONDITIONS, exhibit a faster
   CONVERGENCE_SPEED, and have fewer oscillations around the mpp, according to
   this research.  2021 by the authors.  LICENSEE_MDPI, basel, switzerland.

AB the progress of RENEWABLE_ENERGY is becoming an IMPORTANT_SOURCE for meeting
   ENERGY_REQUIREMENTS of india.  with the PLENTIFUL_AVAILABILITY of
   SOLAR_ENERGY, grid interactive solar photovoltaic (gispv) plants are
   becoming important in most part of the country.  due to varying
   CLIMATIC_CONDITION it is important to predict the DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD of
   GISPV_PLANT. in this paper, NEW_ALGORITHM_RELIEF_ATTRIBUTE_EVALUATOR is used
   to find most influencing variables from SOLAR_RADIATION (sr) and
   BACK_SURFACE_MODULE_TEMPERATURE (bsmt) to predict the DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD of
   190 kwp gispv power plant using RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_NEURAL_NETWORK (rbfnn)
   for 26 DIFFERENT_INDIAN_CITIES. the ranks given by
   RELIEF_ATTRIBUTE_EVALUATOR are 0.00775 for sr and 0.00139 for bsmt, showing
   sr is RELEVANT_VARIABLES for DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD_PREDICTION. for analysis two
   RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_NEURAL_NETWORK (rbfnn 1, rbfnn 2) models are developed
   for the PREDICTION of DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD for the 190 kwp gispv power plant.
   sr and bsmt are used as INPUT_PARAMETERS for the rbfnn 1model and sr is used
   as input for the rbfnn 2 model.  the root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR (rmse) for rbfnn
   1 is 0.2642 kwh/kwp/day and for rbfnn 2 the rmse is 0.2910 kwh/kwp/day.  the
   RESULTS_COMPARISON_SHOWS that RBFNN_PREDICTS DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD better than
   the POLYNOMIAL_REGRESSION_MODEL. the rbfnn 2 model is used to predict
   DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD for 26 DIFFERENT_INDIAN_CITIES and it is found that total
   daily average DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD varies from 3.50 kwh/kwp/day to 7.94
   kwh/kwp/day which can be used to ESTIMATE_POWER_PRODUCTION for
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS. the predicted TOTAL_ARRAY_YIELD by rbfnn 2
   model is validated with calculated value and rmse is found to be 2.295

AB photovoltaic (pv) systems are subject to failures during their operation due
   to the aging effects and external/environmental conditions.  these faults
   may affect the DIFFERENT_SYSTEM_COMPONENTS such as PV_MODULES,
   CONNECTION_LINES, converters/inverters, which can lead to a decrease in the
   EFFICIENCY, performance, and further SYSTEM_COLLAPSE. thus, a KEY_FACTOR to
   be taken into consideration in high EFFICIENCY grid connected PV_SYSTEMS is
   the FAULT_DETECTION_AND_DIAGNOSIS (fdd). the performance of the FDD_METHOD
   depends mainly on the quality of the extracted features including
   REAL_TIME_CHANGES, PHASE_CHANGES, TREND_CHANGES, and FAULTY_MODES. thus, the
   DATA_REPRESENTATION_LEARNING is the CORE_STAGE of
   INTELLIGENT_FDD_TECHNIQUES. recently, due to the enhancement of computing
   capabilities, the increase of the BIG_DATA_USE, and the development of
   EFFECTIVE_ALGORITHMS, the DEEP_LEARNING (dl) tool has witnessed a
   GREAT_SUCCESS in DATA_SCIENCE. therefore, this paper proposes an

SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY 2016
AB WIND_RESOURCE_ASSESSMENT is fundamental when selecting a site for wind
   ENERGY_PROJECTS. wind is influenced by several ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS and
   understanding its SPATIAL_VARIABILITY is key in determining the
   ECONOMIC_VIABILITY of a site.  numerical wind FLOW_MODELS, which solve
   PHYSICAL_EQUATIONS that govern air flows, are the industry standard for
   WIND_RESOURCE_ASSESSMENT. these methods have been proven over the years to
   be able to estimate the WIND_RESOURCE with a relatively HIGH_ACCURACY.
   however, measuring stations, which provide the starting data for every
   WIND_ESTIMATION, are often located at some distance from each other, in some
   CASES_TENS of kilometres or more.  this adds an UNAVOIDABLE_AMOUNT of
   UNCERTAINTY to the estimations, which can be difficult and time consuming to
   calculate with numerical wind FLOW_MODELS. for this reason, even though
   there are ways of computing the OVERALL_ERROR of the estimations, methods
   based on physics fail to provide planners with detailed
   SPATIAL_REPRESENTATIONS of the UNCERTAINTY_PATTERN. in this paper we
   introduce a STATISTICAL_METHOD for estimating the WIND_RESOURCE, based on
   STATISTICAL_LEARNING. in particular, we present an approach based on
   ensembles of REGRESSION_TREES, to estimate the WIND_SPEED and
   DIRECTION_DISTRIBUTIONS continuously over the united kingdom (uk), and
   provide planners with a detailed account of the SPATIAL_PATTERN of the

AB today, for providing CLEAN_ENERGY, solar capturing facilities such as
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS (pv) or SOLAR_THERMAL_COLLECTORS (scts) have been
   increasingly installed worldwide.  on the other side, lack of
   SOLAR_RADIATION_DATA is one of the barriers for developing these
   technologies locally.  short time step calculation of solar
   GLOBAL_IRRADIATION (sgi) on INCLINED_PLANES is required regarding to predict
   PRECISE_PERFORMANCE of SOLAR_SYSTEMS, leading to enhance security
   operation's conditions and ECONOMIC_COST saving.  moreover, SGI_VALUES on
   tilted absorbers have a NONLINEAR_RELATIONSHIP with several variables such
   as HORIZONTAL_SOLAR GLOBAL_IRRADIATION, EXTRATERRESTRIAL_HORIZONTAL
   GLOBAL_IRRADIATION, and number of days, COLLECTOR_ANGLE,
   SOLAR_ALTITUDE_ANGLE and the latitude of the location.  thus computation of
   sgi is neither readily to obtain nor easy to forecast.  this paper is
   proposed on estimating ACCURATE_VALUES of sgi on tilted planes via
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann). indeed, anns are EFFECTIVE_TOOLS to
   MODEL_NONLINEAR_SYSTEMS and are widely used SIMULATION_SOFTWARE incorporated
   in MATLAB. MASHHAD the second megacity of iran is taken into account for the
   CASE_STUDY. the ann is developed and optimized using every 30 min of
   SGI_DATA (6.00 am until 5.00 pm) in 2013 on zero, 45 and 60 INCLINED_PLANES
   respectively.  these data have been gauged by pyranometers which are
   installed in air & SOLAR_INSTITUTE of FERDOWSI_UNIVERSITY of MASHHAD.
   meanwhile, the accuracies including r2 (CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT), mae (mean
   ABSOLUTE_ERROR) and rmse (root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR) are obtained 0.9242,
   0.0284, 0.055 and 0.9302, 0.0269, 0.0549 for 60 and 45 tilted collectors
   respectively.  eventually it is concluded that ann can be a RELIABLE_NETWORK

AB nowadays, learning based modeling methods are utilized to build a precise
   forecast model for RENEWABLE_POWER_SOURCES. computational intelligence (ci)
   techniques have been recognized as effective methods in generating and
   optimizing RENEWABLE_TOOLS. the complexity of this variety of energy depends
   on its coverage of large sizes of data and parameters, which have to be
   investigated thoroughly.  this paper covered the most resent and important
   researchers in the domain of RENEWABLE_PROBLEMS using the learning based
   methods.  VARIOUS_TYPES of deep learning (dl) and machine learning (ml)
   algorithms employed in solar and WIND_ENERGY supplies are given.  the
   performance of the given methods in the literature is assessed by a new
   taxonomy.  this paper focus on conducting comprehensive state of the art
   methods heading to performance evaluation of the given techniques and
   discusses VITAL_DIFFICULTIES and possibilities for extensive research.
   based on the results, variations in efficiency, robustness, ACCURACY_VALUES,
   and generalization capability are the most obvious difficulties for using
   the learning techniques.  in the case of the big dataset, the effectiveness
   of the learning techniques is significantly better than the other
   computational methods.  however, applying and producing hybrid learning
   techniques with other optimization methods to develop and optimize the
   construction of the techniques is optionally indicated.  in all cases,
   hybrid learning methods have better achievement than a single method due to
   the fact that hybrid methods gain the benefit of two or more techniques for
   providing an accurate forecast.  therefore, it is suggested to
   UTILIZE_HYBRID_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES in the future to deal with energy
   generation problems.  2022 by the authors.  licensee mdpi, basel,

AB extracting the OPTIMUM_PARAMETERS of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (pv) model using the
   EXPERIMENTAL_DATA of currentvoltage is very critical in simulating,
   controlling, and optimizing the PV_SYSTEMS. one of the IMPORTANT_PROBLEMS
   encountered in modeling and simulating is to find a model that can
   EXTRACT_PARAMETERS from PV_MODELS quickly, accurately, and reliably.  based
   on this motivation, the goal of this study is to suggest an improved
   algorithm, namely GENETIC_ALGORITHM based on NON_UNIFORM_MUTATION (gamnu),
   in order to approximate efficiently the parameters of SOLAR_CELLS and
   PV_MODULES. in gamnu, NON_UNIFORM_MUTATION operator is used to maintain
   diversity in the explored solutions and the CROSSOVER_OPERATOR follows an
   ADAPTIVE_SEARCH_STRATEGY, which consists of searching the ENTIRE_SPACE at
   the beginning while maintaining a focused search when the POPULATION_TENDS
   to converge in a CERTAIN_REGION of the SEARCH_SPACE. the performance of the
   method is comprehensively evaluated on DIFFERENT_SOLAR_CELL_MODELS,
   including single and DOUBLE_DIODE, and single DIODE_PV_MODULES, of a r.t.c
   france silicon solar cell, esp 160 ppw pv, stp6 120/36 and photowatt pwp201
   module.  the results obtained from single and DOUBLE_DIODE_MODELS for r.t.c
   france are respectively 9.861810 4 and 9.868310 4, and for photowatt pwp201,
   stp6 120/36 and esp 160 ppw are 2.382410 3 2.38242023090010 3, 1.673510
   21.673578650508510 2 and 8.294210 2 8.294210 2. the statistical obtained
   results show that the proposed method has very COMPETITIVE_PERFORMANCE in
   terms of accuracy and reliability when compared to other advanced
   algorithms.  therefore, the proposed algorithm is highly useful to extract
   the parameters of SOLAR_PV_MODELS.  2021 the author(s)

AB in the last few years, methods falling within the family of randomization
   based MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS have grasped a GREAT_INTEREST in the
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_COMMUNITY, mainly due to their EXCELLENT_BALANCE
   between performance in PREDICTION_PROBLEMS and their
   COMPUTATIONAL_EFFICIENCY. the use of these models for PREDICTION_PROBLEMS
   related to RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES has been particularly notable in
   RECENT_TIMES, including DIFFERENT_WAYS in which randomization is considered,
   their hybridization with other modeling techniques and/or their multi
   layered (deep) and ENSEMBLE_ARRANGEMENT. this manuscript comprehensively
   reviews the most IMPORTANT_FEATURES of randomization based
   MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS, and critically examines RECENT_EVIDENCES of their
   application to RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PREDICTION_PROBLEMS, focusing on those
   related to solar, WIND, marine/ocean and HYDRO_POWER RENEWABLE_SOURCES. our
   study of the literature is complemented by an EXTENSIVE_EXPERIMENTAL_SETUP
   encompassing three real world problems dealing with
   SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION, WIND SPEED_PREDICTION in WIND farms and
   HYDRO_POWER energy.  in all these problems randomization based methods are
   reported to achieve a better PREDICTIVE_PERFORMANCE than their corresponding
   state of the art solutions, while demanding a dramatically lower
   COMPUTATIONAL_EFFORT for its LEARNING_PHASES. finally, we pause and reflect
   on important challenges faced by these methods when applied to
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PREDICTION_PROBLEMS, such as their
   INTRINSIC_EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTY, or the need for explainability.  we also
   point out several RESEARCH_OPPORTUNITIES that arise from this
   VIBRANT_RESEARCH_AREA.  2022 elsevier b.v.

AB a CRITICAL_ADVANCEMENT in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (pv) establishment has led to
   ROBUST_ACCELERATION towards the evolution of new mppt techniques.  the sun
   oriented PV_FRAMEWORK has a non linear characteristic in varying
   CLIMATIC_CONDITIONS, which considerably impact the PV_FRAMEWORK_YIELD.
   furthermore, the partial shading condition (psc) causes MAJOR_PROBLEMS, such
   as a drop in the output power yield and multiple peaks in the PV_ATTRIBUTE.
   hence, following the GLOBAL_MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT (gmpp) under psc is a
   demanding problem.  subsequently, DIFFERENT_MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT tracking
   (mppt) strategies have been utilized to improve the yield of a PV_FRAMEWORK.
   however, the disarray lies in choosing the best mppt technique from the
   WIDE_ALGORITHMS for a particular purpose.  each algorithm has its benefits
   and drawbacks.  hence, there is a FUNDAMENTAL_NEED for an APPROPRIATE_AUDIT
   of the mppt strategies from time to time.  this article presents new works
   done in the GLOBAL_POWER_POINT tracking (gmppt) ALGORITHM_FIELD under the
   pscs.  it sums up DIFFERENT_MPPT_STRATEGIES alongside their working
   principle, MATHEMATICAL_REPRESENTATION, and FLOW_CHARTS. moreover, tables
   depicted in this study briefly organize the SIGNIFICANT_ATTRIBUTES of
   algorithms.  this work will serve as a reference for sorting an mppt
   technique while designing PV_SYSTEMS.  2021 by the authors.  LICENSEE_MDPI,

AB the demands for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION are progressively expanding
   because of ENVIRONMENTAL_SAFETY concerns.  RENEWABLE_ENERGY is power
   generated from sources that are constantly replenished.  SOLAR_ENERGY is an
   IMPORTANT_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCE and CLEAN_ENERGY_INITIATIVE. PHOTOVOLTAIC
   (pv) cells or modules are employed to HARVEST_SOLAR_ENERGY, but the accurate
   modeling of PV_CELLS is confounded by nonlinearity, the presence of
   HUGE_OBSCURE_MODEL_PARAMETERS, and the nonattendance of a NOVEL_STRATEGY.
   the efficient modeling of PV_CELLS and ACCURATE_PARAMETER_ESTIMATION is
   becoming more significant for the SCIENTIFIC_COMMUNITY.
   METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS are successfully applied for the
   PARAMETER_VALUATION of PV_SYSTEMS. PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso) is a
   METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHM inspired by ANIMAL_BEHAVIOR. pso and
   DERIVATIVE_ALGORITHMS are EFFICIENT_METHODS to tackle
   DIFFERENT_OPTIMIZATION_ISSUES. HYBRID_PSO_ALGORITHMS were developed to
   improve the performance of BASIC_ONES. this review presents a

   PARAMETER_ASSESSMENT of PV_CELLS. this paper presents how much work is
   conducted in this field, and how much work can additionally be performed to
   improve this strategy and create more IDEAL_ARRANGEMENTS of an issue.

AB to overcome the need of the world for ENERGY_CONSUMPTION, we have to find
   some better and STABLE_ALTERNATE_WAYS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY with advanced
   technology.  the most readily AVAILABLE_SOURCE of energy is SOLAR_ENERGY but
   SOLAR_ENERGY has NONLINEAR_NATURE due to the RANDOM_NATURE of
   CLIMATE_CONDITIONS. so, one way to solve is SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION and
   SOLAR_ENERGY_PREDICTION using more ACCURATE_TECHNIQUES. also,
   ENERGY_BUSINESS and POWER_SYSTEM_CONTROL_UNITS require more accuracy along
   with very short to LARGE_DURATION_PREDICTION in advance.  so, to complete
   the requirement many PREDICTION_TECHNIQUES are used and among them,
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and fuzzy are more accurate and
   RELIABLE_TECHNIQUES. in this paper basically, a LITERATURE_STUDY for
   SOLAR_RADIATION and ENERGY_PREDICTION using ann and FUZZY_LOGIC_TECHNIQUES
   has been carried out.  many studies are reviewed and then selected some most
   accurate, reliable, and RELEVANT_STUDIES for further study.  ANN_MODELS with
   DIFFERENT_ALGORITHMS such as feed forward back propagation based ann, multi
   layer feed forward based ANN_MODEL, LINEAR_REGRESSION with ANN_MODEL, gnn
   based model are reviewed in the study.  ANN_MODELS with
   DIFFERENT_INPUT_PARAMETERS_COMBINATIONS and the DIFFERENT_NUMBER of neurons
   were also reviewed.  FUZZY_LOGIC based and adaptive neuro fuzzy interface
   (anfis) based DIFFERENT_MODELS have been reviewed and observed that the
   ANFIS_TECHNIQUE_PERFORMS better.  from the study, it has been noted that ann
   and FUZZY_LOGIC employed models are most effective for estimation than any
   other EMPIRICAL_MODELS. it is found that SOLAR_RADIATION and

   inadequate to rely on HUMAN_RESOURCES to study all papers.  very few studies
   have used MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS and VISUALIZATION_APPROACHES to
   analyze the trends and directions in WIND_POWER. to explore these, we
   collected 50,579 articles (20122019) from WEB_OF_SCIENCE core collection

   WIND_POWER via analysis of the trends with time sequence, hotspots in

   and iran are the top three countries in the field of WIND_POWER. through
   analyzing the trends between 20122019, we find that RESEARCH_HOTSPOTS have
   changed.  the USAGE_RATE of terms such as POWER_GENERATION_CONTROL,
   POWER_GRIDS, WIND_POWER plants, and wind turbines has significantly
   increased, and the CORRESPONDING_GROWTH_RATES are 10.91%, 7.06%, 6.28% and

   STABILITY_AND_ROBUSTNESS of required nominal performances.  CONTROLLERS with
   fractional order are first obtained by a PREVIOUS_TRANSFORMATION of the
   multi objective optimization problem into an equivalent single optimization
   problem, and then solved by the proposed improved
   PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM. in order to examine the
   STABILITY_AND_PERFORMANCE_ROBUSTNESS, this controller is applied on an ill
   conditioned WIND_TURBINE equipped with a doubly fed ASYNCHRONOUS_MACHINE,
   where the SYSTEM_DYNAMICS is modeled by an unstructured output
   multiplicative uncertainty model.  the SIMULATION_RESULTS show the
   effectiveness of the proposed SYNTHESIS_METHOD, where the control is
   compared (for the same design frequency domain specifications) for both the
   ROBUST_FRACTIONAL_ORDER_CONTROLLER such as that designed through the

AB in RECENT_YEARS, the overwhelming growth of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS (pv)
   ENERGY_GENERATION as an alternative to CONVENTIONAL_FOSSIL_FUEL_GENERATION
   has encouraged the search for efficient and more RELIABLE_OPERATION and
   MAINTENANCE_PRACTICES, since PV_SYSTEMS require CONSTANT_MAINTENANCE for
   CONSISTENT_GENERATION_EFFICIENCY. one option, explored recently, is
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) to replace CONVENTIONAL_MAINTENANCE_STRATEGIES.
   the growing importance of ai in various real life applications, especially
   in SOLAR_PV_APPLICATIONS, cannot be over emphasized.  this study presents an
   EXTENSIVE_REVIEW of ai based methods for FAULT_DETECTION and diagnosis in
   PV_SYSTEMS. it explores VARIOUS_FAULT_TYPES that are common in PV_SYSTEMS
   and various ai based FAULT_DETECTION and DIAGNOSIS_TECHNIQUES proposed in
   the literature.  of note, there are currently fewer literatures in this area
   of PV_APPLICATION as compared to the other areas.  this is due to the fact
   that the topic has just recently been explored, as evident in the oldest

PY 2021
AB SUBSTANTIAL_PROGRESS in solar photovoltaic (spv) dissemination in grid
   connected and STANDALONE_POWER_GENERATION_SYSTEMS has been witnessed during
   the last two decades.  however, WEATHER_INTERMITTENCY has a non linear
   characteristic impact on SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_OUTPUT, which can cause
   CONSIDERABLE_LOSS in the SYSTEMS_OVERALL_OUTPUT. to overcome these
   INEVITABLE_LOSSES and optimize the SPV_OUTPUT, MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT_TRACKING
   (mppt) is mounted in the middle of the power electronics converters and spv
   to achieve the MAXIMUM_OUTPUT with better precision from the SPV_SYSTEM
   under INTERMITTENT_WEATHER_CONDITIONS. as mppt is considered an
   ESSENTIAL_PART of the SPV_SYSTEM, up to now, many researchers have developed
   numerous mppt techniques, each with UNIQUE_FEATURES. a GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_SURVEY
   from 20152021 was performed to scrutinize the number of published review
   papers in this area.  an online search established that on
   DIFFERENT_MPPT_TECHNIQUES, overall, 100 review articles were published; out
   of these 100, seven reviews on CONVENTIONAL_MPPT_TECHNIQUES under shading or
   partial shading and only four under non uniform solar irradiance are
   published.  unfortunately, no dedicated review article has explicitly
   focused on soft computing mppt (sc mppt) techniques.  therefore, a
   COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of articles on sc mppt techniques is desirable, in
   which almost all the familiar sc mppt techniques have to be summarized in
   one piece.  this review article concentrates explicitly on soft computing
   based mppt techniques under non uniform irradiance conditions along with
   their operating principles, block/flow diagram.  it will not only be helpful
   for academics and researchers to provide a FUTURE_DIRECTION in sc mppt
   optimization research, but also help the FIELD_ENGINEERS to select the
   appropriate sc mppt for spv according to SYSTEM_DESIGN and

AU Tsiapoki S; Bahrami O; Hackell MW; Lynch JP; Rolfes R

SO Structural Health Monitoring
PY 2021
AB this article proposes the deployment of ADAPTIVE_BOOSTING (ADABOOST) for
   combining damage feature decisions and improving the DETECTION_ACCURACY of
   STRUCTURAL_HEALTH_MONITORING algorithms.  in STRUCTURAL_HEALTH_MONITORING
   applications, DAMAGE_SENSITIVE_FEATURES are combined with classifiers to
   define DECISION_BOUNDARIES and provide information about the
   STRUCTURAL_STATE. BOOSTING algorithms combine MULTIPLE_CLASSIFIERS aiming at
   the improvement of their performance.  in this study, ADABOOST is deployed
   on the realizations of a MODULAR_STRUCTURAL_HEALTH MONITORING framework,
   which consists of three tiers: DATA_NORMALIZATION based on environmental and
   OPERATIONAL_CONDITIONS; extraction of damage features, also referred to as
   CONDITION_PARAMETERS; and hypothesis testing.  each
   CONDITION_PARAMETERHYPOTHESIS testing PAIR_COMPOSES a classifier which is
   used in ADABOOST as a WEAK_CLASSIFIER. the integration of ADABOOST with the
   STRUCTURAL_HEALTH_MONITORING framework is validated using EXPERIMENTAL_DATA
   of a 3 kw wind turbine located at the LOS_ALAMOS_NATIONAL_LABORATORY and
   data generated from a MECHANICAL_MODEL of the same structure.  the
   ADABOOST_CLASSIFIER is evaluated with respect to the ERROR_RATE as well as
   the true positive and FALSE_POSITIVE_RATES, which are typically used in
   RECEIVER_OPERATING_CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES. the
   ADABOOST_CLASSIFIER_OUTPERFORMS the FRAMEWORK_CLASSIFIERS in many cases,
   improving drastically the DETECTION_PERFORMANCE. however, it is shown that
   the BOOSTING performance depends on the RELATIVE_LOCATION of the
   CONDITION_PARAMETER_VALUES on the CONDITION_PARAMETER_SPACE. the overlaps
   between the CONDITION_PARAMETER_VALUES to be combined are quantified using
   the BHATTACHARYYA_COEFFICIENT, which provides a metric for assessing the
   BOOSTING potential.  finally, omitting CONDITION_PARAMETER_VALUES
   corresponding to SPECIFIC_ENVIRONMENTAL and OPERATIONAL_CONDITIONS from the
   BOOSTING process is proposed for obtaining optimum BOOSTING results.  the

AB NANOSTRUCTURED_SOLAR_CELLS have attracted increasing attention in
   RECENT_YEARS because their LOW_COST and ease of preparation offer
   UNIQUE_ADVANTAGES and opportunities unavailable with conventional
   SINGLE_CRYSTALLINE SOLAR_CELLS. the efficiencies of this kind of SOLAR_CELL
   largely depend on the INTERFACIAL_STRUCTURE owing to the
   LARGE_SPECIFIC_INTERFACE_AREAS and the INHERENT_HIGH_DENSITY of
   INTERFACE_STATES. in this REVIEW_ARTICLE, strategies of
   INTERFACE_ENGINEERING will be introduced in detail.  the up to date progress
   and understanding of INTERFACE_ENGINEERING and its role in influencing the
   efficiency of NANOSTRUCTURED_SOLAR_CELLS will be discussed.  some of the
   REPRESENTATIVE_EXAMPLES of the INTERFACE_ENGINEERING_METHOD will be

   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES like SOLAR_CELLS play a VITAL_ROLE, making
   producing the OPTIMAL_CAPACITY a LEGITIMATE_ASPIRATION for
   SUCH_TECHNOLOGIES_OPERATORS. this article presents an exhaustive and
   CRITICAL_REVIEW of twenty bio inspired METAHEURISTIC_TECHNIQUES and their
   MATHEMATICAL_CONTEXTS brought to action by STOCHASTIC_OPTIMIZATION to
   identify the parameters of SOLAR_CELL_SINGLE_DIODE (sdm) and DOUBLE_DIODE
   (ddm) models.  the novelty embedded within this appraisal lies in rating
   these algorithms and their associated variants according to the accuracy of
   the PARAMETER_EXTRACTION measured by the root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR, which would
   save effort and time for FUTURE_RESEARCHERS and users alike.  additionally,
   this WORK_OUTLINES a GENERAL_METHODOLOGY or pattern followed by every
   algorithm within the BIO_CLASS to find the global best solution.  hence, we
   have concluded: (1) sdm is preferred for
   SOLAR_CELL_PARAMETER_IDENTIFICATION. (2) the firefly ALGORITHM_OUTPACES the
   other algorithms within the ENTIRE_CLASS, while the GENETIC_ALGORITHMS have
   MEDIOCRE_PERFORMANCE, especially with ddm.  (3) the BAT_ALGORITHM_VARIANTS

   an efficient and SUSTAINABLE_ALTERNATIVE to conventional fossil fuels.
   among these sources, SOLAR_POWER emerges as an abundant and feasible energy
   resource for powering VARIOUS_FORMS of energy demanding sectors, such as
   industrial applications and transportation.  SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (pv) systems
   directly transmute the energy in the SOLAR_ELECTROMAGNETIC_RADIATION to
   electrical energy.  however, a SIGNIFICANT_PROBLEM in SOLAR_PV_SYSTEMS is
   PARTIAL_SHADING. a NOTICEABLE_ENERGY_LOSS happens when a SMALL_PORTION of
   the PV_SYSTEM is subject to shading.  there has been increasing attention to
   applying ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) techniques to MITIGATE_PARTIAL

AB DYE_SENSITIZED_SOLAR_CELLS (dsscs) show the most PROMISING_FUTURE of
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_DEVICES due to the LOW_COST, FACILE_FABRICATION, cleanliness,
   and STABLE_PERFORMANCE. in this work, we proposed one goal directed method
   using DATA_MINING techniques integrated with QUANTUM_CHEMICAL_ANALYSIS to
   design n annulated PERYLENE_SENSITIZERS. we constructed the robust
   QUANTITATIVE_STRUCTURE_PROPERTY_RELATIONSHIP (qspr) model via
   MULTIPLE_LINEAR_REGRESSION (mlr), while the GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga) was
   employed to select the CRUCIAL_FEATURES. then we designed the POTENTIAL_DYES
   according to the MODEL_GUIDANCE. the model predicted
   OVERALL_POWER_CONVERSION_EFFICIENCIES (pces) of the designed MOLECULES
   reached 15.7%, increased by 22.0% compared to reference dyes c281. besides,
   DENSITY_FUNCTIONAL_THEORY (dft) and TIME_DEPENDENT_DENSITY_FUNCTIONAL_THEORY
   (td dft) calculations revealed the more favorable CHARGE_TRANSFER and
   OPTOELECTRONIC_PROPERTIES of NEW_MOLECULES. they have NARROW_BANDGAPS (up to
   20.6% reduction), excellent light harvesting efficiency (lhe) curves, and
   large maximum short circuit CURRENT_DENSITIES (20.5% increase). more
   importantly, the PCE_VALUES simulated by QUANTUM_CHEMISTRY are highly
   consistent with the values predicted by QSPR_MODELS. the designed n
   annulated PERYLENE_DYES could be SENSITIZER_CANDIDATES for highly
   EFFICIENT_DSSCS. the novel goal directed approach could potentially

PY 2018
AB in this paper, a new differential particle swarm optimization (dpso) method
   is investigated for tracking the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT (mpp) for the
   photovoltaic (pv) system in order to enhance the operating efficiency of the
   PV_SYSTEM. the dpso based mppt method is not only able to tract the mpp
   using few iterations, but also avoids the steady state oscillation
   phenomenon.  moreover, the proposed method is capable for extracting the
   optimization power under varying TEMPERATURE_CONDITION as well as
   LARGE_FLUCTUATIONS of irradiation.  to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed, the obtained results are compared to those obtained using the
   CONVENTIONAL_PERTURB and observation (p&o), INCREMENTAL_CONDUCTANCE
   (inccond), and CLASSICAL_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso). furthermore, a
   BOOST_CONVERTER supplied by a SOLAR_ARRAY_SIMULATOR is done to check the
   stability of the circuit.  meanwhile, the dpso mppt algorithm is embedded in
   the PV_SYSTEM simulated by using SIMULINK_SOFTWARE and MATLAB_TOOLBOX. the
   simulating results show the superiority of the proposed approach in
   improving the efficiency of the PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM.  2019

   is aimed at predicting just two parameters among the five ones identifying

   PRESENT_HYBRID_APPROACH is efficient from the COMPUTATIONAL_COST_POINT of
   view and accurate in the estimation of the FIVE_PARAMETERS. it constitutes a

   additionally, the GENETIC_ALGORITHM is used.  the forecast current voltage
   characteristic is compared with the one measured in
   REAL_SUNLIGHT_CONDITIONS, and the best results are obtained in the case of a

   LARGE_AMOUNTS of data, EASY_COVERAGE to LOCAL_OPTIMA, and the
   STRICT_ASSUMPTIONS for application.  therefore, in this paper a unsupervised
   ADAPTIVE_PV_ARRAY_RECONFIGURATION_TECHNIQUE is proposed with a
   DIVIDE_AND_CONQUER q learning (dcql) based ARRAY_RECONFIGURATION_SCHEME
   designed to decrease the influence of PARTIAL_SHADES. to testify the
   performance of the proposed PV_ARRAY_RECONFIGURATION_SCHEME,
   MATHEMATIC_THEORETICAL_EVALUATION and ELECTRIC_CHARACTERISTIC_ANALYSES are
   made and compared with those obtained by the conventional total cross tied
   (tct) arrangement, SUDOKU_CONNECTION, GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga) based scheme,
   as well as some lately proposed GRASSHOPPER_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM (goa),
   HARRIS_HAWKS_OPTIMIZER (hho), and LO_SHU (ls) technique based
   RECONFIGURATION_METHODS. besides, ADDITIONAL_ESTIMATION_INDICES, including
   MISMATCH_LOSS, fill factor, PERCENTAGE_POWER_LOSS and
   PERCENTAGE_POWER_ENHANCEMENT are calculated with SUBSTANTIAL_ANALYSES and
   comparisons.  subsequently, the application of the proposed scheme in real
   time conditions is evaluated, with energy saving and INCOME_ANALYSIS
   estimated in comparison with other
   EMINENT_CHALLENGER_RECONFIGURATION_SCHEMES. at last, a
   COMPREHENSIVE_QUALITATIVE_COMPARISON_ASSESSMENT, with respect to
   DISPERSION_ABILITY under PARTIAL_SHADING conditions (psc),
   SENSOR_REQUIREMENT, wiring complexity and CAPITAL_INVESTMENT is carried out
   and proves the versatility of proposed methodology.  2022

   ability to leverage RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES such as wind, photovoltaic
   (pv), and microturbines, which GENERATE_POWER with low greenhouse
   GAS_EMISSIONS, has piqued interest in the POWER_SECTOR. deploying dg in an
   UNFAVORABLE_LOCATION can result in a slew of problems, including increased
   SYSTEM_FAILURES and costs, VOLTAGE_SPIKES and swings, and stability and
   RESILIENCE_ISSUES. as a result, an OPTIMIZATION or perceptual technique
   based paradigm is needed to identify the OPTIMAL_CONFIGURATION of
   distributed RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION for a given system that can provide
   fiscal, environmental, and TECHNOLOGICAL_BENEFITS. several researchers
   looked at the best POSSIBLE_LOCATION for distributed RENEWABLE_GENERATION
   based on their needs and goals.  the FORMAL_THEORY for this issue, however,
   remains unsolved.  INDIVIDUAL_STUDIES on SOLAR_PV_SYSTEMS, types of
   SOLAR_PV_SYSTEMS, WIND_POWER generation, and PUMPED_HYDRO_STORAGE systems
   are all covered in detail in this paper.  in addition, the STUDY_FOCUSES on
   a variety of OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES and algorithms for providing a better

   of many RENEWABLE_RESOURCES in an islanded as well as grid connected

   ENERGY_CONSTITUTES the most matured HYBRID_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEM (hres)
   ALTERNATIVE_TECHNOLOGY against CONVENTIONAL_FOSSIL fuels as it is pollution
   free, easily available, low price, and available in abundance.  the
   INTERMITTENT_NATURE of SOLAR_IRRADIATION and fluctuation in WIND speed makes
   the SYSTEM_DESIGN inappropriate, making it either oversized or undersized.
   due to this, deploying solar pv WIND based hres is becoming either expensive
   or inefficient.  thus, there is an IMMEDIATE_REQUIREMENT for OPTIMIZATION
   problem solving methodologies to minimize the HRES_COSTS. this paper mainly
   focuses on a CRITICAL_COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS of the many applied and

   OPTIMAL_CAPACITY of hres, are categorized as traditional, modern, and hybrid
   on the basis of identified OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS, DECISION_VARIABLES, and
   EVALUATION_INDICATORS. while most of the PRESENT_STUDIES have been based on
   the TECHNICAL_RELIABILITY and ECONOMICAL_PERSPECTIVE of hres, in this paper
   the ENVIRONMENTAL_INDICATORS have got MAJOR_EMPHASIS. the facts emerging out
   of the study indicate that application of hybrid meta heuristic OPTIMIZATION
   techniques for ENGINEERING_APPLICATIONS is growing significantly due to

AB advancements in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGY have significantly reduced the
   CONSUMER_DEPENDENCE on CONVENTIONAL_ENERGY_SOURCES for POWER_GENERATION.
   SOLAR_ENERGY has proven to be a SUSTAINABLE_SOURCE of POWER_GENERATION
   compared to other RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. the performance of a
   PHOTOVOLTAIC (pv) system is highly dependent on the amount of
   SOLAR_PENETRATION to the SOLAR_CELL, the type of CLIMATIC_SEASON, the
   temperature of the surroundings, and the ENVIRONMENTAL_HUMIDITY.
   unfortunately, every RENEWABLES_TECHNOLOGY has its limitation.
   consequently, this prevents the system from operating to a maximum or
   optimally.  achieving a PRECISE_PV_SYSTEM_OUTPUT_POWER is crucial to
   overcoming SOLAR_POWER_OUTPUT_INSTABILITY and INTERMITTENCY_PERFORMANCE.
   this PAPER_DISCUSSES an INTENSIVE_REVIEW of MACHINE_LEARNING, followed by
   the types of NEURAL_NETWORK_MODELS under supervised MACHINE_LEARNING
   implemented in PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER FORECASTING. the literature of
   PAST_RESEARCHERS is collected, mainly focusing on the duration of forecasts
   for very short , short , and long term forecasts in a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM.
   the performance of FORECASTING is also evaluated according to a
   DIFFERENT_TYPE of INPUT_PARAMETER and time step resolution.  lastly, the
   CRUCIAL_ASPECTS of a conventional and HYBRID_MODEL of MACHINE_LEARNING and
   NEURAL_NETWORKS are reviewed comprehensively.  2023 by the authors.

AB an ALTERNATIVE_ENERGY_SOURCE such as solar is one of the most
   IMPORTANT_RENEWABLE_RESOURCES. a RELIABLE_SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION is
   essential for VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS in agriculture, industry, transport, and
   the environment because they reduce GREENHOUSE_GASES and are environmentally
   friendly.  SOLAR_RADIATION_DATA_SERIES have embedded fluctuations and
   NOISE_SIGNALS due to complexity, stochasticity, non stationarity, and
   nonlinearity with uncertain and time varying nature.  aside from being
   highly nonlinear, SOLAR_RADIATION is highly influenced by the environment
   and ENVIRONMENTAL_PARAMETERS such as AIR_TEMPERATURE, cloud cover,
   SURFACE_REFLECTIVITY, and aerosols.  in addition, the SPATIAL_MEASUREMENTS
   of these variables are not readily available.  to tackle these challenges,
   it is necessary to consider data PREPROCESSING_TECHNIQUES and to develop and
   TEST_PRECISE_SOLAR_RADIATION predicting models at different forecast
   horizons.  there is, however, controversy regarding the performance of
   SUCH_MODELS in VARIOUS_STUDIES. comparisons are not conducted systematically
   among the DIFFERENT_STUDIES. using a CRITICAL_LITERATURE_REVIEW, the
   AUTHORS_HOPE to answer these questions and believe that further
   investigation of SOLAR_RADIATION can benefit researchers and practitioners
   alike.  this study presents a COMPREHENSIVE_EVALUATION of SOLAR_RADIATION
   modeling using ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in the last 15 years and provides a
   novel detailed analysis of the AVAILABLE_MODELS. the studies conducted in
   DIFFERENT_CLIMATES of the world that were published in distinguished
   journals were considered (i.e., 90 papers in total) for this purpose.  newly
   discovered procedures for optimizing forecasts, data cleaning, feature
   selection, CLASSIFICATION_METHODS, and stand alone or hybrid data driven
   models for SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION and modeling were evaluated.  the
   results strikingly showed that the most used ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_METHODS
   were ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK, adaptive neuro FUZZY_INFERENCE system, and
   DECISION_TREE_FAMILY of models.  in addition, the EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE,
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE, and PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION were the most used
   OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES in SOLAR_RADIATION modeling.  in terms of forecast
   horizons, the most common forecast horizon found in papers was on the
   DAILY_SCALE (51% of studies), followed by the hourly scale (26%), and the
   least common was the MONTHLY_SCALE (18%). based on the REGIONAL_STUDIES, the
   highest number of SOLAR_RADIATION_PAPERS originated from asia, with europe
   in second place and AFRICAN_COUNTRIES in third place.  an increasing trend
   in the number of papers from 2011 to 2015 was noted, and the second peak
   started from 2018 till the present.  under each section, a summary of
   findings is provided.  the PAPER_CONCLUDES with FUTURE_THOUGHTS and

AB SOLAR_IRRADIATION_DATA are imperatively required for any SOLAR_ENERGY based

   affect the implementation, management, and performance of photovoltaic or
   THERMAL_SYSTEMS. developing SOLAR_IRRADIATION_ESTIMATION and FORECASTING
   approaches is an EFFECTIVE_WAY to overcome these issues.  practically,
   PREDICTION_APPROACHES can help ANTICIPATE_EVENTS by ensuring good operation
   of the POWER_NETWORK and maintaining a PRECISE_BALANCE between the demand
   and supply of the power at every moment.  in the literature,
   VARIOUS_ESTIMATION and FORECASTING methods have been developed.
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) models are the most commonly used methods in
   SOLAR_IRRADIATION_PREDICTION. this PAPER_AIMS to firstly review, analyze,
   and provide an overview of DIFFERENT_ASPECTS required to develop an
   ANN_MODEL for SOLAR_IRRADIATION_PREDICTION, such as DATA_TYPES,
   DATA_HORIZON, data preprocessing, FORECASTING_HORIZON, FEATURE_SELECTION,
   and MODEL_TYPE. secondly, a highly detailed state of the art of ann based
   approaches including DEEP_LEARNING and HYBRID_ANN_MODELS for

SO Joule
PY 2023
AB there is CONSIDERABLE_INTEREST in developing NEW_ENERGY_STORAGE_TECHNOLOGIES
   for the ELECTRIC_GRID, but ECONOMIC_VIABILITY will require that
   manufacturers provide warranties guaranteeing 15+ years of life.  although
   there are EXTENSIVE_EFFORTS to make early predictions for the EXPECTED_LIFE
   of NEW_STORAGE_TECHNOLOGIES, we argue here that for the purposes of pricing
   warranties and valuing second life potentialconsiderations that are crucial
   to whether the technologies can be commercializedthe
   FULL_FAILURE_PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTION, not just the EXPECTED_LIFE, is
   required.  we use published battery cycle life data to suggest efficient
   statistical and MACHINE_LEARNING based testing and ANALYSIS_STRATEGIES that
   can rapidly estimate and also take advantage of the
   FAILURE_PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTION. one approach is a WEIBULL_ANALYSIS, which
   can (1) reduce the number of testing MACHINE_HOURS required for setting a
   warranty, (2) quickly determine whether a NEW_TECHNOLOGY is better than a
   BASELINE_TECHNOLOGY, and (3) estimate the MAXIMUM_INTENSITY of testing
   ACCELERATION that does not change the FAILURE_MODE. a second approach is
   driven by the idea that all measured datasuch as capacity or energy as a
   function of time or CYCLE_NUMBERARE valuable and generated by an underlying
   LATENT_FUNCTION. this analysis employs a GAUSSIAN_PROCESS to find the
   underlying LATENT_FUNCTION, together with its uncertainties, which can be
   used to calculate the FAILURE_DISTRIBUTION.  2023 ELSEVIER_INC.

   PREDICTIVE_TECHNIQUES are available for the EFFICIENT_USE of wind energy.
   this article, which is a review of methods of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai)
   and META_HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS for wind ENERGY_PREDICTION, fits into this
   context.  there are two DISTINCT_CATEGORIES: the first consists of
   TRADITIONAL_METHODS that are commonly used in this context, like
   DIFFERENT_TYPES of ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (ann), SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES
   (svm) and FUZZY_LOGIC; the second is a combined approach which mixes the
   CLASSIC_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_METHODS and the META_HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS
   for the optimization of the forecast output.  then, a summary and comparison
   between the methodologies are established, and the advantages and limits of
   each technique are defined.  the combination of the
   CLASSIC_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS has a greater
   performance than the utilization of CLASSIC_METHODS only.  nevertheless,

AB RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES are present copiously in the nature and are good
   for ENVIRONMENTAL_CONSERVATION as they restore themselves and thus have
   CONSIDERABLE_POTENTIAL in the NEAR_FUTURE. it is hence important to
   concentrate on the forecast of these ENERGY_SOURCES in order to make
   EFFECTIVE_USE of them as soon as possible.  this paper is focused primarily
   on SOLAR_ENERGY. there are many approaches that could be applied for the
   prediction of GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION (gsr). in the field of
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai), the FORECASTING of SOLAR_RESOURCES has moved
   from CONVENTIONAL_MATHEMATICAL_APPROACHES to the use of
   INTELLIGENT_TECHNIQUES. the extent to which data based decisions are made
   for planning such as judicious and functional for the SOLAR_ENERGY_SECTOR
   has been increased to a LARGE_EXTENT by this GIANT_STEP. in modelling
   challenging and UNPREDICTABLE_CONNECTIONS in between a set of INPUT_DATA and
   OUTPUT_DATA along with SPECIFIC_PATTERNS that occur between datasets,
   AI_TECHNIQUES have demonstrated increasing reliability.  in this regard,
   purpose of this paper is to provide a synopsis of SOLAR_ENERGY FORECASTING
   methods utilizing MACHINE_LEARNING and DEEP_LEARNING_APPROACHES to the best
   of our understanding.  2023, the author(s) under EXCLUSIVE_LICENCE to

   POPULAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_DEVICES due to their HIGH_POWER_CONVERSION_EFFICIENCIES
   (pces), low cost RAW_MATERIALS and SIMPLE_PRODUCTION_PROCESSES. however,
   METAL_HALIDE_PEROVSKITES_DECOMPOSE rapidly in the presence of HUMID_AIR,
   LIGHT_ILLUMINATION and heat, which is unfavorable for the

   for assisting the discovery of promising three dimensional (3d) perovskites
   and two dimensional (2d) layered perovskites as light absorbing materials.
   the ML_MODELS to predict high efficient pscs are also reviewed.  in the end,
   we discuss the advantages and challenges of ML_METHODS as well as their

AB RENEWABLE_ENERGY is now in HIGH_DEMAND due to the DETERIORATION of the
   GLOBAL_CLIMATE and the depletion of CONVENTIONAL_SOURCES.
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (res) such as WIND and solar are extremely
   intermittent, making it impossible to SUSTAIN_SYSTEM_RELIABILITY with an
   unacceptably HIGH_PROPORTION of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INJECTION. an
   INTRINSIC_ATTRIBUTE common to all RENEWABLE_POWER_PLANTS is that the
   production of ENERGY_RELIES on ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS such as temperature,
   pressure, WIND speed, humidity, clouds, etc.  therefore, the POWER from res
   cannot be completely regulated or pre planned.  it is important to forecast
   the amount of electricity that can be produced in a POWER_GRID for
   FUTURE_DEMAND. MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) is an emerging technology and used in
   all FIELDS_NOWADAYS to perform DIFFERENT_TASKS. in this paper, the
   applications of MACHINE_LEARNING in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES are discussed.
   these ML_TECHNIQUES are mainly used to predict the POWER from
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES like WIND, solar, hydro, BIOMASS, tidal, and
   geothermal.  FAULT_DETECTION is a SIGNIFICANT_ASPECT in
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS to reduce the operation and MAINTENANCE_COST and to
   deliver the CONTINUOUS_POWER to the loads.  this paper also focusses on the
   use of ML_TECHNIQUES in predicting the FAULTS before it occurs,
   EARLY_DETECTION of FAULTS and also to diagnose the FAULTS in
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS. along with the above mentioned applications, these
   ML_TECHNIQUES used in res for DIFFERENT_PURPOSES are also discussed.  2022

AB RAPID_DEVELOPMENT of PHOTOVOLTAICS_INDUSTRY emphasizes the importance of a
   long term RELIABLE_DATASET of SURFACE_SOLAR_RADIATION (rs). however, long
   term satellite retrievals usually suffer from INHOMOGENEITY due to the
   INHOMOGENEOUS_INPUT_DATA from DIFFERENT_SATELLITES.
   ATMOSPHERIC_REANALYSIS_RS_DATA have STABLE_QUALITY but relatively lower
   accuracy.  in this study, a CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK based
   HOMOGENIZATION_METHOD is developed to use a REANALYSIS_DATASET (era5) as a
   bridge to homogenize a 36 year (19832018) satellite based RS_DATASET (so
   called isccp itp) with 10 km spatial resolution and 3 hr interval, which has
   HIGH_ACCURACY after 2000 (MONTHLY_RMSE of 16.9 w/m2 and mbe of 0.2 w/m2) but
   relatively lower accuracy before 2000 (MONTHLY_RMSE of 18.2 w/m2 and mbe of
   7.2 w/m2). the method is based on u net algorithm, which CONTAINS_ENCODER,
   decoder and skipped CONNECTION_PARTS. MONTHLY_RS of isccp itp and era5 after
   2000 are used as LABEL_DATA and INPUT_DATA for the training, respectively,
   and MONTHLY_RS of era5 before 2000 is fed into the trained model to
   GENERATE_HOMOGENIZATION_RESULTS. after HOMOGENIZATION, the rmse and mbe of
   the monthly isccp itp data are reduced to 15.8 w/m2 and  1.6 w/m2,
   respectively, before 2000, which are comparable to those after 2000, making
   the accuracy of the NEW_DATASET stable throughout the WHOLE_PERIOD.
   moreover, the variations and trends of rs derived from the NEW_DATA are
   consistent with in situ observations at global and REGIONAL_SCALES.
   therefore, the HOMOGENIZATION can contribute to the re construction of a
   high quality long term RS_DATASET suitable for PHOTOVOLTAICS_INDUSTRY.  2022

AB the MULTIPHASE_INDUCTION_MOTOR can be a highly PREFERABLE_CHOICE for the
   EV_APPLICATION, where the reliability and safety of passengers are one of
   the major concerns.  the MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this article is to
   DESIGN_HIGH_PERFORMANCE_FAULT_TOLERANT_CONTROL of FIVE_PHASE_INDUCTION_MOTOR
   (fpim) drive to enhance the DYNAMIC_PERFORMANCE under healthy, faulty and
   FAULT_TOLERANT_MODES of operation under arbitrary
   OPEN_PHASE_FAULT_CONDITION. first, a SIMPLE_METHOD of modeling
   OPEN_PHASE_FAULT in any phase of the FPIM_DRIVE is proposed.  the most
   frequently occurring OPEN_PHASE_FAULTS due to the
   POWER_ELECTRONICS_SWITCH_FAILURE in the inverters are considered for the
   analysis.  a generalized method of modeling arbitrary OPEN_PHASE_FAULT in
   FPIM_DRIVE using back EMF_CALCULATIONS in FAULTY_PHASE is suggested.  the
   developed METHOD_UTILIZES the same TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX for any
   OPEN_PHASE_FAULT such that the MINIMUM_MODIFICATION in CONTROL_STRATEGY is
   required under FAULT_CONDITION. thereafter, the CONTROL_TECHNIQUE is
   detailed.  the ROTOR_FIELD_ORIENTED_CONTROL (rfoc) of fpim with
   FUZZY_LOGIC_SPEED_CONTROLLER is developed to
   GENERATE_OPTIMAL_TORQUE_REFERENCE. the design of flc is detailed with fine
   tuned scaling factor, RULE_BASE and MEMBERSHIP_FUNCTION to obtain
   ROBUST_PERFORMANCE of the drive under healthy and FAULT_TOLERANT_MODES of
   operation.  the COMPLETE_RFOC_SCHEME for 2 HP_FPIM_DRIVE is built in
   matlab/simulink incorporating FUZZY_LOGIC_BASED_CONTROLLER to verify its
   performance.  the comparison of transient and STEADY_STATE_RESPONSE and
   robustness (to the LOAD_DISTURBANCE as well as fault) obtained using
   developed FUZZY_LOGIC_BASED_CONTROLLER with those using
   CONVENTIONAL_PI_CONTROLLER is presented to prove the efficiency of the
   suggested controller under VARIOUS_SPEED_TORQUE_PROFILES. the effectiveness
   of the proposed fuzzy based FAULT_TOLERANT_CONTROLLER for FPIM_DRIVE is
   validated using op4510 controller based REAL_TIME_HIL_SIMULATOR.   2021

AB background: ECONOMIC_LOAD_DISPATCH (eld) is the process of applying
   NECESSARY_LOAD_DEMAND between generators in POWER_SYSTEM that satisfies all
   units, so as to decrease the cost of operation.  in order to solve the
   ELD_PROBLEM, META_HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS are preferred.  the combination of
   FIRE_FLY (ff) algorithm and GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga) is used in this research
   to solve the ELD_PROBLEM and optimize the WIND_ENERGY_OUTPUT. methods: the
   WIND_TURBINE_ROTATES by the force of the wind from nature.  the
   OPTIMUM_VALUES of the INPUT_PARAMETERS of WIND_TURBINE such as cp,  are
   predicted using GENETIC_ALGORITHM. thus, the WIND_TURBINE_OUTPUT is
   optimized.  the output of the generator is optimized by the MPPT_METHODS in
   practice.  the MPPT_METHOD deployed here is INCREMENTAL_CONDUCTANCE_METHOD.
   the WIND_ENERGY_OUTPUT is ac in nature.  it is converted to dc using
   RECTIFIER_ACTION. then the BOOST_CONVERTER further boosts the OUTPUT_VALUE.
   the INVERTER_ACTION_CONVERTS the dc into ac and fed to grid.  the fuel
   operating cost of the WIND_ENERGY_SYSTEM is reduced by means of the ffa thus
   solves the ELD_PROBLEM. the WIND_ENERGY_SYSTEM with optimized power to grid
   is implemented using MATLAB_SIMULINK_TOOL and eld is solved and executed by
   means of matlab coding.  results: the INPUT_PARAMETERS of WIND_TURBINE such
   as cp and  values are predicted by means of GENETIC_ALGORITHM, in order to
   obtain OPTIMAL_OUTPUT from the turbine.  the POWER_COEFFICIENTS (cp) and tip
   speed  value of the WIND_TURBINE are found out, thus the WIND_TURBINE_OUTPUT
   is optimized.  the GENERATOR_OUTPUT is optimized by MPPT_TECHNIQUE.
   conclusion: by adopting GENETIC_ALGORITHM the INPUT_PARAMETER_VALUE required
   for WIND_TURBINE is predicted.  the ECONOMIC_LOAD_DISPATCH_PROBLEM is solved
   and COST_FUNCTION is minimized by deploying FIREFLY algorithm.  the
   WIND_POWER_OUTPUT is optimized by hybrid ga ffa and the optimized power is
   fed to grid thus enhancing GRID_EFFICIENCY. the results obtained were tested
   using matlab/simulink platform.  2018 BENTHAM_SCIENCE_PUBLISHERS.

   the advantages of fast and ACCURATE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_DEFECT_DETECTION. based on
   the classical yolo v5 algorithm, the ATTENTION_MECHANISM and bidirectional
   feature PYRAMID_NETWORK were adopted to improve the accuracy of

AB RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES can be deployed locally and efficiently using the
   concept of microgrids.  due to the NATURAL_UNCERTAINTY of the OUTPUT_POWER
   of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES, the planning for a PROPER_OPERATION of
   microgrids can be a CHALLENGING_TASK. in addition, the information about the
   loads and the POWER_CONSUMPTION of them can create benefits to increase the
   efficiency of the microgrids.  however, ELECTRICAL_LOADS can have
   uncertainty due to reasons such as UNPREDICTABLE_BEHAVIOR of the consumers.
   to exploit a microgrid, ENERGY_MANAGEMENT is required at the UPPER_LEVEL of
   operation and control in order to reduce the costs.  one of the most
   IMPORTANT_TASKS of the ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM is to satisfy the loads and,
   in other words, develop a plan to maintain equilibrium between the
   POWER_GENERATION and POWER_CONSUMPTION. to obtain information about the
   OUTPUT_POWER of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES and POWER_CONSUMPTION,
   DEEP_LEARNING can be implemented as a POWERFUL_TOOL, which is able to
   predict the desired values.  in addition, WEATHER_CONDITIONS can affect the
   OUTPUT_POWER of renewable energy based resources and the behavior of the
   consumers and, as a result, the POWER_CONSUMPTION. so, DEEP_LEARNING can be
   deployed for the anticipation of the WEATHER_CONDITIONS. this paper will
   study the RECENT_WORKS related to DEEP_LEARNING, which has been implemented
   for the prediction of the OUTPUT_POWER of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES (i.e.,
   pvs and wind turbines), ELECTRICAL_LOADS, and WEATHER_CONDITIONS (i.e.,
   SOLAR_IRRADIANCE and wind speed). in addition, for
   POSSIBLE_FUTURE_DIRECTIONS some strategies are suggested, the most important
   of which is the implementation of QUANTUM_COMPUTING in
   CYBERPHYSICAL_MICROGRIDS.  2023 by the authors.

AB a PV_SYSTEM is subject to RANDOM_VARIATIONS in ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS, and
   continuous tracking of the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT is an INDISPENSABLE_STEP to
   improve the PV_OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY. NUMEROUS_TECHNIQUES of
   MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT tracking have been reported in the literature.  however,
   these TECHNIQUES_SUFFER from NUMEROUS_PROBLEMS such as oscillation around
   the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT and do not provide SATISFACTORY_ROBUSTNESS. taking
   into account the NONLINEAR_NATURE of the PV_MODULE and
   POWER_ELECTRONICS_CONVERTERS in PV_SYSTEMS, NONLINEAR_CONTROL represents a
   VITAL_CONTROL_SOLUTION to guarantee both an optimal and ROBUST_PV_SYSTEM.
   the NONLINEAR_CONTROL_STRATEGY proposed in this WORK_FORMS a closed loop
   system between the PV_MODULE, boost converter, load, an
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL for REFERENCE_PREDICTION, and an
   INTEGRAL_BACKSTEPPING controller.  the stability of the controller has been
   verified by LYAPUNOV_THEORY and the controller has been optimized using the
   PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso) method.  NUMERICAL_SIMULATIONS with
   RIGOROUS_ROBUST_TESTS have proved the SUPERIOR_PERFORMANCE of the proposed
   controller as compared to perturb and observe, and pso terminal sliding

AB when using EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHMS to optimize WIND_FARM_LAYOUTS, it is
   computationally expensive to use COMPUTATIONAL_FLUID_DYNAMICS (cfd) model to
   evaluate DIFFERENT_WIND_FARM_LAYOUTS. to alleviate the difficulty,
   SURROGATE_MODELS are used to replace CFD_MODEL. SUCH_ALGORITHMS are called
   surrogate assisted EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHMS (saeas). in existing saeas,
   constructing a GLOBAL_SURROGATE for high dimensional problems is not
   reliable due to the curse of dimensionality.  additionally, a
   LOCAL_SURROGATE_MODEL constructed with a fixed number of samples has
   limitations.  to address these problems, an saea combining
   GLOBAL_EXPLORATION and LOCAL_EXPLOITATION is proposed.  the
   GLOBAL_EXPLORATION is based on an adaptive surrogate assisted
   PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM, while the LOCAL_EXPLOITATION is based
   on a local rbf assisted SIMULATED_ANNEALING_ALGORITHM. in building a

AB the sustainability of the earth depends on RENEWABLE_ENERGY. forecasting the
   output of RENEWABLE_ENERGY has a BIG_IMPACT on how we operate and manage our
   POWER_NETWORKS. accurate forecasting of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION is
   crucial to ensuring GRID_DEPENDABILITY and permanence and reducing the risk
   and cost of the ENERGY_MARKET and infrastructure.  although there are
   several approaches to forecasting SOLAR_RADIATION on a GLOBAL_SCALE, the two
   most COMMON_ONES are MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS and CLOUD_PICTURES combined
   with PHYSICAL_MODELS. the objective is to present a summary of
   MACHINE_LEARNING based techniques for SOLAR_IRRADIATION forecasting in this
   context.  RENEWABLE_ENERGY is being used more and more in the
   WORLDS_ENERGY_GRID. NUMEROUS_STRATEGIES, including hybrids, PHYSICAL_MODELS,

AB PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY_ATTRACTS_RESEARCHERS from industry and academia due
   to its potential in producing electricity directly from the sunlight.  among
   all the PHOTOVOLTAIC_DEVICES, the DYE_SENSITIZED SOLAR_CELL has gained
   preference due to its LOW_COST_FABRICATION and versatility in ELECTROLYTES,
   dye, substrate, and catalyst.  the optical, electrical, and
   STRUCTURAL_PROPERTIES of the materials determine the
   POWER_CONVERSION_EFFICIENCY of a SOLAR_CELL. but, conducting experiments in
   the laboratory to identify the SUITABLE_MATERIALS for the FABRICATION of an
   EFFICIENT_SOLAR_CELL requires much time, cost, and HUMAN_EFFORT. the proven
   potential of MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES in PATTERN_MATCHING and
   COMPUTER_VISION motivated the researchers to employ these techniques for
   predicting the EFFICIENCY of SOLAR_CELLS. the research works conducted so
   far show the applications of these techniques in predicting the
   OPTIMUM_EFFICIENCY, best SUITABLE_DESIGN, and material for the FABRICATION
   of DYE_SENSITIZED_SOLAR_CELLS (dsscs). in this paper, the authors present a
   COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of the MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES employed and the
   types of INPUT_DATA used for predicting the design and EFFICIENCY of
   SOLAR_CELLS. they also give ESSENTIAL_INSIGHTS into the selection of
   OPTIMUM_PARAMETERS for selecting the materials for fabricating a substrate,
   DYE_SENSITIZER, semiconductor, electrolyte, and catalyst for designing the
   most efficient DYE_SENSITIZED SOLAR_CELL without conducting experiments in
   the laboratory.  this paper may prove a time and cost saving assistant for
   developing a customized NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL for predicting the EFFICIENCY
   of a DSSC from the dataset available in the literature.  highlights:
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) model is useful to identify the
   SUITABLE_MATERIALS for EFFICIENT_DSSC_ASSEMBLY. the tailored
   NEURAL_NETWORK_MODELS_MINIMIZE the need for hit and TRIAL_EXPERIMENTS. the
   hybrid of ann and GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga) offers a low cost technological
   solution for DSSC_ASSEMBLY. the EXPERIMENTAL_DATA are vital for extracting
   USEFUL_INSIGHTS for DSSC_FABRICATION.  2022 JOHN_WILEY & SONS_LTD.

AB a transition to SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS is considered one of the most
   IMPORTANT_ALTERNATIVES to CONVENTIONAL_FOSSIL fuels.  until recently,
   SOLAR_AIR_HEATERS (sahs) were among the other SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS that have
   been widely used in VARIOUS_HOUSEHOLDS and INDUSTRIAL_APPLICATIONS. however,
   the RECENT_LITERATURE_REVEALS that efficiencies of sahs are still low.  some
   METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS have been used to enhance the efficiencies of these
   SAH_SYSTEMS. in the paper, we do not only discuss the techniques used to
   enhance the PERFORMANCE of sahs, but we also reviewed a majority of
   published papers on the applications of SAH_OPTIMIZATION. the
   METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS include SIMULATED_ANNEALING (sa),
   PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso), GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga),
   ARTIFICIAL_BEE_COLONY (abc), teaching learning based optimization (tlbo),
   and elitist teaching learning based optimization (etlbo). for this research,
   it should be noted that this study is mostly based on the literature
   published in the last ten years in GOOD_ENERGY_TOP_JOURNALS. therefore, this
   paper clearly shows that the use of all six proposed
   METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS_RESULTS in SIGNIFICANT_EFFICIENCY_IMPROVEMENTS
   through the selection of the OPTIMAL_DESIGN set and operating parameters for
   sahs.  based on the PAST_LITERATURE and on the outcomes of this paper, etlbo
   is unquestionably more competitive than abc, ga, pso, sa, and tlbo for the
   optimization of sahs for the same considered problem.  finally, based on the
   covered six state of the art metaheuristic techniques, some perspectives and
   recommendations for the FUTURE_OUTLOOK of SAH_OPTIMIZATION are proposed.
   this paper is the first ever attempt to present the CURRENT_DEVELOPMENTS to
   a LARGE_AUDIENCE on the applications of METAHEURISTIC_METHODS in
   SAH_OPTIMIZATION. thus, researchers can use this paper for further research
   and for the advancement of the proposed and other recommended algorithms to
   generate the best PERFORMANCE for the VARIOUS_SAHS.   2021 jean de
