AB as RENEWABLE_ENERGY becomes increasingly popular in the
   GLOBAL_ELECTRIC_ENERGY_GRID, improving the accuracy of RENEWABLE_ENERGY
   FORECASTING is critical to POWER_SYSTEM_PLANNING, management, and
   operations.  however, this is a CHALLENGING_TASK due to the intermittent and
   CHAOTIC_NATURE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_DATA. to date, VARIOUS_METHODS have been
   developed, including PHYSICAL_MODELS, STATISTICAL_METHODS,
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNIQUES, and their hybrids to improve the
   FORECASTING_ACCURACY of RENEWABLE_ENERGY. among them, DEEP_LEARNING, as a
   PROMISING_TYPE of MACHINE_LEARNING capable for discovering the
   INHERENT_NONLINEAR features and high level invariant structures in data, has
   been frequently reported in the literature.  this paper provides a
   comprehensive and EXTENSIVE_REVIEW of RENEWABLE_ENERGY FORECASTING methods
   based on DEEP_LEARNING to explore its effectiveness, efficiency and
   APPLICATION_POTENTIAL. we divide the existing deterministic and
   PROBABILISTIC_FORECASTING methods based on DEEP_LEARNING into four groups,
   namely DEEP_BELIEF_NETWORK, stack auto encoder,
   DEEP_RECURRENT_NEURAL_NETWORK and others.  we also dissect the FEASIBLE_DATA
   preprocessing techniques and error post correction methods to improve the
   FORECASTING_ACCURACY. EXTENSIVE_ANALYSIS and discussion of
   VARIOUS_DEEP_LEARNING based FORECASTING methods are given.  finally, we
   explore the CURRENT_RESEARCH_ACTIVITIES, challenges and potential

AB MACHINE_LEARNING is a SPECIFIC_APPLICATION of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE that
   allows computers to learn and improve from data and experience via sets of
   algorithms, without the need for reprogramming.  in the field of
   ENERGY_STORAGE, MACHINE_LEARNING has recently emerged as a promising
   modelling approach to determine the state of charge, STATE_OF_HEALTH and
   remaining USEFUL_LIFE of batteries.  first, we review the two most studied
   types of BATTERY_MODELS in the literature for BATTERY_STATE_PREDICTION: the
   EQUIVALENT_CIRCUIT and PHYSICS_BASED_MODELS. based on the
   CURRENT_LIMITATIONS of these models, we showcase the promise of
   VARIOUS_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES for fast and
   ACCURATE_BATTERY_STATE_PREDICTION. finally, we highlight the major
   challenges involved, especially in accurate modelling over length and time,
   performing in SITU_CALCULATIONS and HIGH_THROUGHPUT_DATA generation.

SO IEEE Access
PY 2020
AB the growing interest and recent breakthroughs in ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and
   machine learning (ml) have actively contributed to an increase in
   RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT of new methods to estimate the states of
   electrified VEHICLE_BATTERIES. data driven approaches, such as ml, are
   becoming more popular for estimating the STATE_OF_CHARGE (soc) and
   STATE_OF_HEALTH (soh) due to greater availability of BATTERY_DATA and
   improved computing power capabilities.  this paper provides a survey of
   battery STATE_ESTIMATION_METHODS based on ml approaches such as feedforward
   neural networks (fnns), RECURRENT_NEURAL_NETWORKS (rnns),
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES (svm), radial basis functions (rbf), and hamming
   networks.  comparisons between methods are shown in terms of data quality,
   inputs and outputs, TEST_CONDITIONS, battery types, and stated accuracy to
   give readers a bigger picture view of the ml landscape for soc and
   SOH_ESTIMATION. additionally, to provide insight into how to best approach
   with the comparison of different neural network structures, an fnn and long
   short term memory (lstm) rnn are trained fifty times each for 3000 epochs.
   the error is somewhat different for each TRAINING_REPETITION due to the
   random initial values of the TRAINABLE_PARAMETERS, demonstrating that it is
   important to TRAIN_NETWORKS multiple times to achieve the best result.
   furthermore, it is recommended that when performing a comparison among
   estimation techniques such as those presented in this REVIEW_PAPER, the
   compared networks should have a SIMILAR_NUMBER of learnable parameters and
   be trained and tested with identical data.  otherwise, it is difficult to
   make a general conclusion regarding the quality of a given estimation
   technique.  2013 ieee.

AB in the last decades, the consumption of petrol in the TRANSPORT_SECTOR has
   increased at a higher pace than in any other sector.  transport represents a
   quarter of the total amount of greenhouse gases and 36% of energy
   consumption in spain.  as a consequence, a new law regarding emissions has
   been approved.  SUCH_LAW_REGULATES the ACCEPTABLE_EMISSION_LEVELS of
   combustion gases for new vehicles sold in any of the european union member
   states.  this WORK_DEALS with PARALLEL_HYBRID_ELECTRIC_VEHICLES in order to
   face the increasing environmental pollution and reduce energy consumption.
   the PRESENT_PAPER_SHOWS a modelling of electric and parallel hybrid electric
   vehicle using matlab/simulink environment which allows us to access
   different aspects of the vehicle such as engine power, type and size of the
   battery or weight and to observe how changes can affect the performance and
   the distance travelled.  the model was simulated in order to obtain the
   electric vehicle's autonomy.  through the use of a geographic information
   system together with a mathematic algorithm based on genetic algorithms the
   planning of CHARGING stations was obtained, where the installation
   investment cost was minimized and the geographic distribution was improved
   in order to increase the quality of the service by improving reliability.
   after a simulation which took place in a city of spain, zaragoza, losses
   were reduced from 156.60 to 115.27.  2017

AB POLY(ETHYLENE_OXIDE) (peo) based POLYMER_ELECTROLYTES are extensively
   investigated, and they have rapidly developed in ALL_SOLID_STATE_BATTERIES
   (assbs) over RECENT_YEARS for their GOOD_INTERFACE_CONTACT with electrodes,
   easy shaping and DECENT_FLEXIBILITY. however, their LOW_IONIC_CONDUCTIVITY
   remains a SERIOUS_ISSUE to be solved urgently.  researchers have found that
   the addition of FILLERS can improve the ionic conductivityviacreating more
   AMORPHOUS_REGIONS_CONDUCIVE to ION_TRANSPORT in peo.  here, we adopted
   WASTE_EGGSHELL as a precursor to prepare a sub micron filler, which is
   mainly cao, and it was added into the PEO_ELECTROLYTE to get a
   COMPOSITE_POLYMER_ELECTROLYTE. close contactvialewis base acid interaction
   between cao and peo can be obtained, as cao is an EFFECTIVE_FILLER with
   STRONG_ALKALINITY. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time it
   is applied in the PEO_ELECTROLYTE. the filler significantly decreases the
   CRYSTALLINITY of peo, and hence, boosted IONIC_CONDUCTIVITY of the
   COMPOSITE_POLYMER_ELECTROLYTE is observed, which is about 4.5 times higher
   than that of the POLYMER_REFERENCE_ELECTROLYTE. it additionally brings a
   higher TENSILE_STRENGTH along with a more STABLE_ELECTROCHEMICAL_WINDOW (up
   to 5 v) to the COMPOSITE_ELECTROLYTE. therefore, as expected, the all solid

   nanofibers, 2d nanosheets and 3d cross link networks.  nb fe7s8/mos2 cnfs
   display the SPECIAL_DUAL confined effects, which are the space and

   cnfs in POTASSIUM_ION_BATTERIES (pibs) are explored by ex situ methods,
   which confirm that DUAL_CONFINED_EFFECT can alleviate the VOLUME_EXPANSION

   TRANSPORTATION_SECTOR. nonetheless, capacity deteriorating with time and
   usage, ENVIRONMENTAL_DEGRADATION_FACTORS, and end of life repurposing pose
   significant challenges to the usage of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES. in this
   aspect, determining a batterys remaining USABLE_LIFE (rul) establishes its
   efficacy.  it also aids in the testing and development of
   VARIOUS_EV_UPGRADES by identifying factors that will increase and improve
   their efficiency.  several nonlinear and complicated parameters are involved

AB STATE_OF_CHARGE (soc) of the lithium ion batteries is one of the key
   parameters of the BATTERY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM, which the PERFORMANCE of
   SOC_ESTIMATION_GUARANTEES_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_EFFICIENCY and endurance mileage
   of electric vehicles.  however, ACCURATE_SOC_ESTIMATION is a difficult
   problem owing to complex chemical reactions and nonlinear battery
   characteristics.  in this paper, the method of the dynamic neural network is
   used to estimate the soc of the lithium ion batteries, which is improved
   based on the classic close loop nonlinear auto regressive models with
   exogenous input neural network (narxnn) model, and the open loop narxnn
   model considering expected output is proposed.  since the input delay,
   feedback delay, and hidden layer of the dynamic neural network are usually
   selected by empirically, which affects the estimation PERFORMANCE of the
   dynamic neural network.  to cover this weakness, SINE_COSINE_ALGORITHM (sca)
   is used for global optimal dynamic neural network parameters.  then, the
   experimental results are verified to obtain the effectiveness and robustness
   of the proposed method under different conditions.  finally, the dynamic
   neural network based on sca is compared with unscented kalman filter (ukf),
   back PROPAGATION_NEURAL_NETWORK based on particle swarm optimization (bpnn
   pso), least squares support vector machine (ls svm), and gaussian process

   SAFETY_STRATEGIES through acquiring BATTERY_DATA such as CURRENT, voltage,
   and temperature.  VARIOUS_METHODS of STATE_ESTIMATION are practically and
   technically analyzed and offered in the literature including physics based,
   model based, and data driven approaches.  among them, the RECENT_METHOD
   seems to be a NOVEL_SOLUTION to overcome the
   CURRENT_EXPERIMENTAL_DIFFICULTIES and inaccuracies.  in a data driven
   method, the battery is considered as a BLACK_BOX while a LARGE_VOLUME of
   data is applied to learn the INTERNAL_DYNAMICS of the battery, using
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) and MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) approaches.  however,
   there are still MAJOR_UNCERTAINTIES and hurdles in the application and using
   ai in eps due to DATA_SOURCE_SCARCITY, the complexity of computation, and
   ambiguities in the AIRWORTHINESS_CERTIFICATION_PROCESS. in this study, a
   SYSTEMATIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW is performed; 948 papers were selected to be
   analyzed precisely in both qualitative and QUANTITATIVE_APPROACHES to
   provide descriptive, metadata, and BMS_FUNCTION_ANALYSIS_REPORTS. the goal
   of the research is to review BMS_STRATEGIES supported by
   INTELLIGENT_ALGORITHMS to propose APPROPRIATE_SOLUTIONS for
   BATTERY_MANAGEMENT of eps based on the proposed bms NECESSARY_FUNCTIONS.
   moreover, CURRENT_AIRWORTHINESS_CERTIFICATION_REGULATIONS are analyzed, and
   it is shown that the existing status is insufficient to satisfy
   CRITICAL_ISSUES for employing DATA_DRIVEN_METHODS in the BATTERY_MANAGEMENT
   of FUTURE_ELECTRIC_AIRCRAFT including AI_SAFETY_RISK_ASSESSMENT and
   LEARNING_ASSURANCE. finally, trends show an increase in studies on the
   subject of AI_THEMES_APPLICATION in BATTERY_STATE_ESTIMATION during the last
   ten years, especially for the state of charge and the state of health.
   however, there are still gaps in research for the application of
   INTELLIGENT_TECHNOLOGY in state of function (sof) and state of power (sop)
   estimation as one of the most IMPERATIVE_FUNCTIONS of the bms in ea, which
   consists of less than 1 % of the TOTAL_STUDIES in this field.  2022

AB ACCURATE_TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION is one of the most CRITICAL_PROBLEMS to
   improve BATTERY_PERFORMANCE, and prevent THERMAL_RUNAWAY. however, the
   HEAT_GENERATION and HEAT_DISSIPATION of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES have
   COMPLEX_NONLINEAR_CHARACTERISTICS and are easily affected by
   EXTERNAL_FACTORS, therefore it is difficult to accurately predict the
   BATTERY_TEMPERATURE. in RECENT_YEARS, ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) has
   been widely used in many fields of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES due to its
   UNIQUE_ADVANTAGES in dealing with highly non linear problems, such as
   battery modeling and SOC_ESTIMATION, RESIDUAL_LIFE (rul) prediction and
   BATTERY_TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION. however, there are few studies on
   TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES in
   FOAM_METAL_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM, and the CURRENT_RESEARCH has not
   reached an ACCURATE_CONCLUSION to explain which NEURAL_NETWORK is better for
   TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION. therefore, an ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_APPROACH was
   used to estimate the temperature change of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES in the
   METAL_FOAM_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM. back PROPAGATION_NEURAL_NETWORK (bp
   nn), RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTIONS_NEURAL_NETWORK (rbf nn) and
   ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORKS (elman nn) were respectively applied to establish the
   TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION_MODEL, and the TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION_PERFORMANCE of
   DIFFERENT_NEURAL_NETWORK modeling techniques were compared.  in order to
   verify the accuracy and validity of the NEURAL_NETWORK_THERMAL_MODEL, the
   PERFORMANCE_TESTS under the SAMPLE_CONDITION and the NEW_CONDITION were
   carried out respectively.  the predicted RESULT_DATA and
   TEMPERATURE_CONTRAST_DIAGRAM of sample and TEST_CONDITIONS are obtained.
   ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL has better adaptability and
   GENERALIZATION_ABILITY, and the training time of ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL
   is shorter.  it is more suitable for the TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION of libs

AB with an increasingly wider application of the lithium ion battery (lib),
   specifically the DRASTIC_INCREASE of ELECTRIC_VEHICLES in
   COSMOPOLITAN_CITIES, improving the thermal and FIRE_RESILIENCE of
   LIB_SYSTEMS is inevitable.  thus, in depth analysis and performance based
   study on BATTERY_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM (btms) design have arisen as a

AB transportation is currently advancing towards electric vehicle (ev)
   technology.  this paper presents a brief and SYSTEMATIC_ANALYSIS of the
   REAL_TIME issues obtained in electric vehicles (evs) due to the various
   ranges of energy storage devices.  in general, ev energy management system
   is integrated with power electronic circuits for effective power conversion
   and RELIABLE_OPERATION. some issues are addressed while using the batteries
   in ev systems such as CHARGING time, efficiency of battery, and
   RAW_MATERIALS. not only BATTERY_ISSUES but also REAL_TIME non technical
   issues and operational issues are also discussed in this paper.  during
   energy conversion with power electronic circuits, the
   SYSTEM_ATTAINS_EXTREME_TEMPERATURE_LEVELS which in TURN_REDUCES the
   performance of the system.  to maintain an optimum TEMPERATURE level, it is
   important to study the TEMPERATURE_EFFECT of the system at the most prior
   levels.  due to the adaption of power electronic components, some extent of
   noise is generated, technically treated as electromagnetic interference
   (emi), as SYSTEM_CAPACITY_INCREASES the emi content also improved
   proportionately.  therefore, to mitigate the emi effect, the low pass filter
   based emi filter is introduced in the system such that the noise level is
   suppressed.  bidirectional CHARGING system (bcs) is one of the emerging
   technologies in ev to obtain AUTONOMOUS_POWER supply systems in the form of
   vehicle to grid (v2g), grid to vehicle (g2v), and vehicle to load (v2l). to
   know the behaviour of bcs the proposed RNN_CONTROLLER is employed and is
   compared with ANN_BIDIRECTIONAL CHARGING model.  bcs CHARGING system with
   RNN_CONTROLLER has better dynamic response to exchange the power via dc/dc
   converter and ac/dc converter as compared to ANN_CONTROLLER.   2013 ieee.

AB electrochemical CO2_REDUCTION reaction (co2rr) is an IMPORTANT_PROCESS which
   is a POTENTIAL_WAY to recycle excessive co2 in the atmosphere.  although the
   electrocatalyst is the key toward efficient co2rr, the progress of
   discovering EFFECTIVE_CATALYSTS is lagging with CURRENT_METHODS. because of
   the cost and TIME_EFFICIENCY of the MODERN_MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) algorithm,
   an increasing number of researchers have applied ml to accelerate the
   screening of SUITABLE_CATALYSTS and to deepen our understanding in the
   mechanism.  hence, we reviewed RECENT_APPLICATIONS of ml in the research of
   co2rr by the types of electrocatalyst.  an introduction on the

AB solar is a SIGNIFICANT_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCE. SOLAR_ENERGY can provide for
   the WORLDS_ENERGY_NEEDS while minimizing global warming from
   TRADITIONAL_SOURCES. forecasting the output of RENEWABLE_ENERGY has a
   CONSIDERABLE_IMPACT on decisions about the operation and management of
   POWER_SYSTEMS. it is crucial to accurately forecast the output of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES in order to assure GRID_DEPENDABILITY and
   sustainability and to reduce the risk and expense of ENERGY_MARKETS and
   systems.  RECENT_ADVANCEMENTS in LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY (lstm) have
   attracted researchers to the model, and its PROMISING_POTENTIAL is reflected
   in the METHODS_RICHNESS and the growing number of papers about it.  to
   facilitate further research and development in this area, this
   PAPER_INVESTIGATES_LSTM_MODELS for forecasting SOLAR_ENERGY by using time
   series data.  the paper is divided into two parts: (1)
   INDEPENDENT_LSTM_MODELS and (2) HYBRID_MODELS that INCORPORATE_LSTM as
   another type of technique.  the root mean SQUARE_ERROR (rmse) and other
   ERROR_METRICS are used as the REPRESENTATIVE_EVALUATION_METRICS for
   comparing the accuracy of the selected methods.  according to
   EMPIRICAL_STUDIES, the two types of models (INDEPENDENT_LSTM and hybrid)
   have DISTINCT_ADVANTAGES and disadvantages depending on the scenario.  for
   instance, LSTM_OUTPERFORMS the other STANDALONE_MODELS, but HYBRID_MODELS
   generally OUTPERFORM_STANDALONE_MODELS despite their longer
   DATA_TRAINING_TIME_REQUIREMENT. the most NOTABLE_DISCOVERY is the better
   suitability of lstm as a PREDICTIVE_MODEL to forecast the amount of
   SOLAR_RADIATION and PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER compared with other
   CONVENTIONAL_MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS.  2023 by the authors.

   is crucial.  it provides KEY_FUNCTIONS such as BATTERY_STATE_ESTIMATION
   (including STATE_OF_CHARGE, STATE_OF_HEALTH, BATTERY_SAFETY, and

AB TRADITIONAL_FERTILIZERS are highly inefficient, with a MAJOR_LOSS of
   nutrients and associated pollution.  alternatively, biochar loaded with
   phosphorous is a SUSTAINABLE_FERTILIZER that IMPROVES_SOIL_STRUCTURE,
   STORES_CARBON in soils, and provides PLANT_NUTRIENTS in the LONG_RUN, yet
   most biochars are not optimal because MECHANISMS_RULING_BIOCHAR_PROPERTIES
   are poorly known.  this issue can be solved by RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS in
   MACHINE_LEARNING_AND_COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY. here we review
   PHOSPHORUS_LOADED_BIOCHAR with emphasis on COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY,
   MACHINE_LEARNING, ORGANIC_ACIDS, drawbacks of CLASSICAL_FERTILIZERS,
   BIOCHAR_PRODUCTION, phosphorus loading, and mechanisms of
   PHOSPHOROUS_RELEASE. modeling techniques allow for deciphering the influence
   of INDIVIDUAL_VARIABLES on biochar, employing various supervised
   LEARNING_MODELS tailored to DIFFERENT_BIOCHAR_TYPES. COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY
   provides knowledge on factors that CONTROL_PHOSPHORUS binding, e.g., the
   type of PHOSPHORUS_COMPOUND, SOIL_CONSTITUENTS, MINERAL_SURFACES, binding
   motifs, water, SOLUTION_PH, and REDOX_POTENTIAL. PHOSPHORUS_RELEASE from
   biochar is controlled by coexisting anions, ph, ADSORBENT_DOSAGE,
   INITIAL_PHOSPHORUS_CONCENTRATION, and temperature.  PYROLYSIS_TEMPERATURES
   below 600 C_ENHANCE FUNCTIONAL_GROUP_RETENTION, while temperatures below 450
   C_INCREASE plant available phosphorus.  lower PH_VALUES promote
   PHOSPHORUS_RELEASE, while higher PH_VALUES_HINDER it.
   PHYSICAL_MODIFICATIONS, such as increasing SURFACE_AREA and PORE_VOLUME, can
   maximize the ADSORPTION_CAPACITY of PHOSPHORUS_LOADED_BIOCHAR. furthermore,
   the type of ORGANIC_ACID_AFFECTS_PHOSPHORUS_RELEASE, with
   LOW_MOLECULAR_WEIGHT_ORGANIC_ACIDS being advantageous for SOIL_UTILIZATION.
   lastly, biochar based FERTILIZERS_RELEASE_NUTRIENTS 24 times slower than

AB the requirements and availability of the ELECTRIC_POWERTRAIN will be
   significantly increased with the introduction of AUTOMATED_DRIVING
   functions.  in this case, the MECHANICAL_FALLBACK_LEVEL of the driver must
   be replaced by a fault tolerant system.  NEW_CONCEPTS such as the
   PREDICTIVE_DIAGNOSTIC or customized OPERATION_STRATEGIES_ENSURE the
   FAULT_TOLERANCE. an ESSENTIAL_COMPONENT to realize the requirements is the
   ELECTRIC_DRIVE. in the PRESENT_WORK, a method for the prediction of the
   FAULT_CONDITION in PERMANENT_MAGNET_SYNCHRONOUS_MOTOR (pmsm) is developed
   based on ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (ann). not only the FAILURE_OCCURRENCE
   is detected, but also the severity of the failure is predicted and
   classified.  for this purpose, a SUITABLE_FAILURE_INDICATOR is needed, which
   contradicts the severity of the failure and thus allows both the prediction
   and degradation (protection) of the system.  the prerequisite for the use of
   MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS, such as ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS, is the
   existence of a database.  data is obtained with the help of SIMULATION_MODEL
   of pmsm, which can be corrected with failures.  features from the
   PHASE_CURRENTS and the battery current in the TIME_DOMAIN and in the
   FREQUENCY_DOMAIN are presented as well as CLASSICAL_METHODS such as the
   WAVELET_ANALYSIS or the decomposition into SYMMETRICAL_COMPONENTS. the
   selection of the features has a GREAT_INFLUENCE on the DIAGNOSTIC_RESULT and
   on the performance of the algorithm.  the failures are represented by the
   features in the FREQUENCY_DOMAIN. based on these aspects, several
   NEURAL_NETWORKS are formed.  to predict the failure, an accuracy of about
   95% is achieved and for the classification an accuracy of about 98.5%.
