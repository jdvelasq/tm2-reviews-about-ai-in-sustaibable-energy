Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that efficiently convert chemical energy stored in fuels directly into electrical energy, exemplified by the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells which can achieve a practical conversion efficiency as high as 65% [57]. A significant component of these fuel cells is the electrocatalyst, which plays a crucial role in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) essential for fuel cell function [75]. Specifically, platinum-based electrocatalysts with open nanoarchitectures have shown superior performance due to the increased exposure of reactive surfaces [75]. In addition to fuel cells, there are other energy storage and conversion systems, such as rechargeable batteries. The design and discovery of materials for these batteries, including electrode materials and electrolytes, are being accelerated by machine learning [63]. Furthermore, the electrocatalysis of water splitting has been explored as a promising avenue for producing hydrogen, which can then be utilized in hydrogen-based energy storage and conversion systems [4].

perspective and POSSIBLE_BLUEPRINT for a FUTURE_BATTERY_RESEARCH_STRATEGY \

Fuel cells, which can be characterized as electrochemical devices, serve the essential function of transforming the chemical energy securely held in fuels straight into electrical energy. A prime example of this is the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. These specific fuel cells boast the ability to reach a notable conversion efficiency of up to 65% [57]. The role of the electrocatalyst in these fuel cells cannot be underestimated. It is fundamental for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a step that is quintessential for the functioning of the fuel cell [75]. Electrodes doped with noble metals, especially platinum-based ones featuring open nanoarchitectures, tend to demonstrate better performance. This superior performance is attributed to the larger exposure of reactive surfaces [75]. 

Beyond fuel cells, the sphere of energy storage and conversion also encompasses devices like rechargeable batteries. The advent of machine learning techniques has exponentially sped up the development of materials essential for these batteries, such as electrode materials and electrolytes [63, 115]. Machine learning is proving to be a significant asset in accelerating the research and development of novel battery systems, aiding in predicting and discovering new battery materials [115].

Electrocatalysis, particularly in the context of water splitting, is steadily emerging as a promising method to produce high-density, green hydrogen [79]. This hydrogen, once produced, has potential applications in hydrogen-centric energy storage and conversion mechanisms [4]. Noble metal doping (like Ru, Rh, and Ir) has been identified as crucial in enhancing the water splitting electrocatalysis efficiency, addressing challenges like low water adsorption on the catalyst surface [79]. Thus, electrocatalysis serves not only as a platform for energy conversion but also as a crucial process for hydrogen production.

Electrodes fortified with noble metals, primarily those that are platinum-based and possess open nanoarchitectures, have been observed to offer enhanced performance. The reason behind this improved functionality is largely due to the augmented exposure of reactive surfaces [75].

The realm of energy storage and conversion isn't limited to fuel cells. It also includes other devices such as rechargeable batteries. The introduction of machine learning techniques has been instrumental in expediting the development of key materials for these batteries, particularly electrode materials and electrolytes [63, 115]. Specifically, machine learning offers a valuable tool for accelerating the exploration and formulation of innovative battery systems by predicting and unveiling novel battery materials [115, 121].

Electrocatalysis, when applied to water splitting, presents a burgeoning avenue for producing dense, environmentally friendly hydrogen [79]. Once generated, this hydrogen can be utilized in diverse energy storage and conversion processes [4]. Certain noble metals, like Ru, Rh, and Ir, have been recognized as imperative for boosting the efficiency of water splitting electrocatalysis. This enhancement addresses specific issues such as the inadequate water adsorption on the catalyst surface [79]. In this manner, electrocatalysis not only offers a means for energy conversion but also plays an indispensable role in hydrogen production.

Fuel cells operate as electrochemical devices that directly transform chemical energy from fuels into electrical energy. Notably, Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, a distinct subset of these devices, boast an impressive conversion efficiency reaching as high as 65% [57]. At the heart of these fuel cells is the electrocatalyst, which takes on a pivotal role, especially during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR process is a crucial step, ensuring that the fuel cell operates efficiently [75]. Electrodes augmented with noble metals, especially those grounded in platinum and integrated with open nanoarchitectures, exhibit superior performance. The heightened functionality of these electrodes can be attributed to the increased exposure of their reactive surfaces, enabling more effective electrochemical reactions [75].

The spectrum of energy storage and conversion extends beyond just fuel cells. It encompasses other devices, notably rechargeable batteries. Recent innovations in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning have significantly accelerated the development of essential materials for these batteries, most prominently electrode materials and electrolytes. Machine learning, in particular, has emerged as a potent tool, propelling the exploration and development of avant-garde battery systems. This is achieved by predicting and uncovering revolutionary battery materials, thus expanding the horizons of battery research [115, 121]. Furthermore, imaging techniques such as X_RAY_COMPUTED_TOMOGRAPHY (nano ct) have been pivotal in studying battery material behavior, and the integration of machine learning with these techniques has furthered our understanding of electrode microstructures and their impact on battery performance [111].

Electrocatalysis, especially when geared towards water splitting, opens up new frontiers for producing concentrated, eco-friendly hydrogen [79]. Once procured, this hydrogen serves multiple energy storage and conversion procedures [4]. Some noble metals, including Ru, Rh, and Ir, are paramount in amplifying the efficiency of water splitting through electrocatalysis. These enhancements tackle inherent challenges like insufficient water adsorption on the catalyst surface [79]. Therefore, electrocatalysis not only offers a pathway for energy conversion but also becomes essential in hydrogen production processes.

Title: ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_APPLICATION in SOLID_STATE mg based \
HYDROGEN_ENERGY_STORAGE
Abstract:
```
the use of mg based compounds in SOLID_STATE HYDROGEN_ENERGY_STORAGE has \
a very HIGH_PROSPECT due to its HIGH_POTENTIAL, low cost, and ease of \
availability. today, SOLID_STATE HYDROGEN_STORAGE science is concerned \
with understanding the MATERIAL_BEHAVIOR of DIFFERENT_COMPOSITIONS and \
structure when interacting with hydrogen. finding a SUITABLE_MATERIAL has \
remained an ELUSIVE_IDEA, and therefore, this REVIEW_SUMMARIZES_WORKS by \
VARIOUS_GROUPS, the milestones they have achieved, and the roadmap to be \
taken on the study of HYDROGEN_STORAGE using low cost magnesium \
composites. mg based compounds are further examined from the perspective \
of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_STUDIES, which helps to improve prediction of \
their properties and HYDROGEN_STORAGE_PERFORMANCE. there exist several \
techniques to improve the performance of mg based compounds: \
MICROSTRUCTURE_MODIFICATION, use of CATALYTIC_ADDITIVES, and \
COMPOSITION_REGULATION. MICROSTRUCTURE_MODIFICATION is usually achieved \
by employing DIFFERENT_SYNTHETIC_TECHNIQUES like \
SEVERE_PLASTIC_DEFORMATION, HIGH_ENERGY_BALL milling, and cold rolling, \
among others. these SYNTHETIC_APPROACHES are discussed herein. in this \
review, a discussion of KEY_PARAMETERS and operating conditions are \
highlighted in a view to finding HIGH_STORAGE_CAPACITY and faster \
kinetics. furthermore, RECENT_APPROACHES like MACHINE_LEARNING have found \
application in guiding the EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN. hence, this REVIEW_PAPER \
also explores how MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES have been utilized to \
fasten the MATERIALS_RESEARCH. it is however noted that this study is not \
exhaustive in itself.  2021 by the authors. LICENSEE_MDPI, basel, \

Title: boosting the water splitting activity of COBALT_NITRIDE through \
MORPHOLOGICAL_DESIGN: a comparison of the influence of structure on the \
HYDROGEN and OXYGEN evolution reactions
Abstract:
```
to deal with the relatively low her CATALYSIS_EFFICIENCIES of existing \
COBALT_NITRIDE (con) catalysts, it is highly desirable to design \
NEW_TYPES of CON_CATALYSTS to realize high efficiency water splitting. \
herein, by using simple hydrothermal and NITRIDATION_METHODS, we realize \
the synthesis of novel three dimensional (3d) flower like con (con f), \
CON_POROUS_SPHERES (con s), and polyhedral con (con p)viautilizing \
VARIOUS_WEAK_BASES. benefiting from a much larger surface area and a \
unique 3d flower like architecture (consisting of 2d porous \
CON_NANOSHEETS), the con f catalyst shows highly exposed ACTIVE_SITES and \
superior mass/electron transfer abilities. naturally, the con f catalyst \
exhibits more OUTSTANDING_HYDROGEN_EVOLUTION_REACTION (her) and \
OXYGEN_EVOLUTION_REACTION (oer) CATALYTIC_PERFORMANCE than either con p \
or con s. in order to achieve a CURRENT_DENSITY of 10 ma cm2, 3d flower \
like con f needs ONLY_LOW_OVERPOTENTIALS of 191.7 mv and 276.2 mv for the \
her and oer, respectively. furthermore, upon using the 3d flower like con \
f catalyst as both the anode and CATHODE_MATERIAL in a two ELECTRODE \
overall water splitting cell, the corresponding ()con fcon f(+) cell \
achieves a CURRENT_DENSITY of 10 ma cm2at 1.613 v in 1.0 M_KOH, which is \
just 10 mv larger than a ()pt/cruo2(+) cell (1.592 v). it outperforms \
most existing non precious metal ELECTROCATALYSTS, demonstrating superior \
water splitting efficiency. in addition, the 3d flower like con f \
catalyst shows EXCELLENT_STABILITY during the alkaline her and oer, and \
FULL_WATER splitting. this work successfully opens a NEW_PATHWAY for \
boosting the her/oer electrocatalytic abilities of CON_CATALYSTS through \
structural design, which may promote the EFFICIENT_UTILIZATION of \
METAL_NITRIDES in VARIOUS_ENERGY_STORAGE and CONVERSION_DEVICES.  the \

Title: boosting ELECTROCATALYTIC_WATER splitting by MAGNETIC_FIELDS
Abstract:
```
OVERALL_WATER splitting efficiency is retarded by the kinetics of the \
SLUGGISH_OXYGEN_EVOLUTION_REACTION (oer). recently, increasing attention \
has been attracted to the spin sensitive nature of the oer and the \
utility of MAGNETIC_FIELDS (mf) for enhancing CATALYTIC_PERFORMANCE. \
actually, mf should have performed even better, if we had a correct and \
COMPREHENSIVE_UNDERSTANDING of its POSSIBLE_EFFECTS on the \
WHOLE_OER_SYSTEM. herein, we comprehensively discuss all POSSIBLE_EFFECTS \
of mf on the oer, including the MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC_EFFECT in the \
electrolyte, the SPIN_SELECTIVITY_EFFECT in the interface, and the \
SPIN_ALIGNMENT and MAGNETOTHERMAL_EFFECTS in electrocatalysts. we point \
out that the mf type/setup and the magnetism of electrocatalysts are the \
two PRIMARY_DETERMINANTS for the REAL_EFFECTIVENESS of mf. this \
perspective is expected to provide INSTRUCTIVE_GUIDANCE for utilizing \
MAGNETIC_FIELDS to improve the performance of WATER_SPLITTING as well as \

Abstract:
```
QUANTUM_DOT_SENSITIZED_SOLAR_CELLS (qdsscs) have become important in \
dealing with the energy economy environment dilemma of today's world. \
qdsscs offer a UNIQUE_SET of characteristics including \
MULTIPLE_EXCITON_GENERATION and higher EXTINCTION_COEFFICIENTS associated \
with QUANTUM_DOTS (qds), avowing its potential for \
HIGH_PHOTOCONVERSION_EFFICIENCY (pce), which is evident from its \
augmented increase of the pce to  15 % within the PAST_DECADE. to make \
FULL_USE of the PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL_COMPETENCE of qdsscs, researchers \
have strategically dealt with VARIOUS_DETRIMENTAL_EVENTS taking place \
within qds and on INTERFACIAL_POSITIONS in photoanodes. BACK_TRANSFER of \
photogenerated electrons, electron/hole RECOMBINATION via \
SURFACE_DEFECTS, and photocorrosion of qds seriously deteriorate the \
performance of qdsscs and are thus considered a bottleneck for their \
further improvements. DEPOSITION of INTERFACIAL_LAYERS (ils) has proven \
beneficial in this regard and hence, it requires a \

qdsscs, ils offer single or MULTIPLE_ROLES in improving the pce: \
improvement of SURFACE_PASSIVATION (PASSIVATION_ILS), DEPOSITION of qds \
(seeding ils), and/or control of the BACK_TRANSFER of electrons to the \

Title: RECENT_ADVANCES of the CONFINEMENT_EFFECTS boosting ELECTROCHEMICAL co2 \

Abstract:
```
powered by clean and RENEWABLE_ENERGY, ELECTROCATALYTIC \
CO2_REDUCTION_REACTION (co2rr) to CHEMICAL_FEEDSTOCKS is an EFFECTIVE_WAY \
to mitigate the GREENHOUSE_EFFECT and artificially close the \
CARBON_CYCLE. however, the performance of ELECTROCATALYTIC co2rr was \
impeded by the STRONG_THERMODYNAMIC_STABILITY of co2 molecules and the \
HIGH_SUSCEPTIBILITY to HYDROGEN_EVOLUTION_REACTION (her) in \
AQUEOUS_PHASE_SYSTEMS. moreover, the NUMEROUS_REACTION_INTERMEDIATES \
formed at very near POTENTIALS_LEAD to POOR_SELECTIVITY of \
REACTION_PRODUCTS, further preventing the industrialization of co2rr. \
CATALYSIS in confined space can enrich the REACTION_INTERMEDIATES to \
improve their coverage at the ACTIVE_SITE, INCREASE_LOCAL_PH to inhibit \
her, and accelerate the MASS_TRANSFER rate of reactants/products and \
subsequently facilitate co2rr performance. therefore, we summarize the \
RESEARCH_PROGRESS on the application of the CONFINEMENT_EFFECTS in the \
direction of co2rr in theoretical and EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECTIONS. we first \
analyzed the mechanism of the CONFINEMENT_EFFECT. subsequently, the \
CONFINEMENT_EFFECT was discussed in VARIOUS_FORMS, which can be \
characterized as an ABNORMAL_CATALYTIC_PHENOMENON due to the \
RELATIVE_LIMITATION of the REACTION_REGION. in specific, based on the \
PHYSICAL_STRUCTURE of the catalyst, the CONFINEMENT_EFFECT was divided in \
four categories: PORE_STRUCTURE_CONFINEMENT, \
CAVITY_STRUCTURE_CONFINEMENT, ACTIVE_CENTER_CONFINEMENT, and other \
CONFINEMENT_METHODS. based on these discussions, we also have summarized \
the prospects and challenges in this field. this REVIEW_AIMS to stimulate \
