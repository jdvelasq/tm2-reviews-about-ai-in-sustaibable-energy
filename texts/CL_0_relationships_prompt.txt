Title: MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS for SOLAR_RADIATION_FORECASTING: a review
Abstract:
```
FORECASTING the OUTPUT_POWER of SOLAR_SYSTEMS is required for the \
GOOD_OPERATION of the POWER_GRID or for the OPTIMAL_MANAGEMENT of the \
ENERGY_FLUXES occurring into the SOLAR_SYSTEM. before FORECASTING the \
SOLAR_SYSTEMS_OUTPUT, it is essential to focus the prediction on the \
SOLAR_IRRADIANCE. the GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION FORECASTING can be performed \
by several methods; the two BIG_CATEGORIES are the CLOUD_IMAGERY combined \
with PHYSICAL_MODELS, and the MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS. in this context, \
the objective of this paper is to give an overview of FORECASTING methods \
of SOLAR_IRRADIATION using MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES. although, a lot \
of papers describes methodologies like NEURAL_NETWORKS or \
SUPPORT_VECTOR_REGRESSION, it will be shown that other methods \
(REGRESSION_TREE, RANDOM_FOREST, gradient boosting and many others) begin \
to be used in this context of prediction. the performance ranking of \
SUCH_METHODS is complicated due to the diversity of the DATA_SET, \
TIME_STEP, FORECASTING horizon, set up and PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS. \
overall, the error of prediction is quite equivalent. to improve the \
PREDICTION_PERFORMANCE some authors proposed the use of HYBRID_MODELS or \
to use an ensemble forecast approach.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

review
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_RADIATION_DATA_PLAYS an IMPORTANT_ROLE in SOLAR_ENERGY_RESEARCH. \
these data are not available for location of interest due to absence of a \
METEOROLOGICAL_STATION. therefore, the SOLAR_RADIATION has to be \
predicted accurately for these locations using \
VARIOUS_SOLAR_RADIATION_ESTIMATION_MODELS. the MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this \
study is to review ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) based techniques in \
order to identify SUITABLE_METHODS available in the literature for \
SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION and to IDENTIFY_RESEARCH_GAPS. the STUDY_SHOWS \
that ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_TECHNIQUES predict SOLAR_RADIATION more \
accurately in comparison to CONVENTIONAL_METHODS. the PREDICTION_ACCURACY \
of ANN_MODELS is found to be dependent on INPUT_PARAMETER_COMBINATIONS, \

Abstract:
```
this paper presents the RESEARCH_RESULTS of a comparison of three \
DIFFERENT_MODEL based approaches for WIND_TURBINE FAULT_DETECTION in \
ONLINE_SCADA_DATA, by applying developed models to five real measured \
faults and anomalies. the REGRESSION_BASED_MODEL as the simplest approach \
to build a NORMAL_BEHAVIOR_MODEL is compared to two \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK based approaches, which are a \
FULL_SIGNAL_RECONSTRUCTION and an autoregressive NORMAL_BEHAVIOR_MODEL. \
based on a REAL_TIME_SERIES containing two generator bearing damages the \
capabilities of identifying the INCIPIENT_FAULT prior to the \
ACTUAL_FAILURE are investigated. the period after the first \
BEARING_DAMAGE is used to develop the three NORMAL_BEHAVIOR_MODELS. the \
developed or trained models are used to investigate how the second \
DAMAGE_MANIFESTS in the PREDICTION_ERROR. furthermore the \
FULL_SIGNAL_RECONSTRUCTION and the AUTOREGRESSIVE_APPROACH are applied to \
further REAL_TIME_SERIES containing gearbox bearing damages and \
STATOR_TEMPERATURE_ANOMALIES. the comparison revealed all THREE_MODELS \
being capable of detecting INCIPIENT_FAULTS. however, they differ in the \
effort required for MODEL_DEVELOPMENT and the remaining OPERATIONAL_TIME \
after first indication of damage. the \
GENERAL_NONLINEAR_NEURAL_NETWORK_APPROACHES_OUTPERFORM the \
REGRESSION_MODEL. the remaining SEASONALITY in the \
REGRESSION_MODEL_PREDICTION_ERROR makes it difficult to \
DETECT_ABNORMALITY and leads to increased ALARM_LEVELS and thus a shorter \
remaining OPERATIONAL_PERIOD. for the bearing damages and the \

nonlinear and they depend on ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS such as temperature \
and irradiance. VARIABLE_ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS cause to change \
voltage, current and also cause to change MAXIMUM_AVAILABLE_POWER of \
PV_PANELS. to increase EFFICIENCY and decrease PAYBACK_PERIOD of the \

to find MPP_CHANGES, from 94.8% to 99.4%. to charge a battery there are \
two TRADITIONAL_METHODS which are constant current (cc), and \
CONSTANT_VOLTAGE (cv) methods. for fast CHARGING with LOW_LOSS constant \
current and VOLTAGE_SOURCE is a need. one of the methods providing \
constant is PI_CONTROL which used in this study. PI_CONTROL is not only \
well developed and a SIMPLE_TECHNIQUE but also it provides \
SATISFACTORY_RESULTS. the goal of this study is operating PV_PANEL at \

models are found to be 20.12%, 6.89% and 9.04% respectively, showing \
13.23% improved PREDICTION_ACCURACY of the ann 2 model which \
UTILIZES_TEMPERATURE, MAXIMUM_TEMPERATURE, MINIMUM_TEMPERATURE, height \
above SEA_LEVEL and SUNSHINE_HOURS as INPUT_VARIABLES in comparison to \
the ann 1 model. the WEKA_IDENTIFIES_TEMPERATURE, MAXIMUM_TEMPERATURE, \

RELEVANT_INPUT_VARIABLES and latitude, longitude as the least influencing \
variables in SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION. the methodology is also used to \
identify the SOLAR_ENERGY_POTENTIAL of WESTERN_HIMALAYAN_STATE of \
HIMACHAL_PRADESH, india. the results show GOOD_SOLAR_POTENTIAL with \
yearly SOLAR_RADIATION_VARIATION as 3.59 5.38 kwh/m2/day for a \

Title: the ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK for SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION and \
designing SOLAR_SYSTEMS: a SYSTEMATIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_ENERGY generated by sunlight has a non schedulable nature due to \
the STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENT of METEOROLOGICAL_CONDITIONS. hence, \
POWER_SYSTEM_CONTROL and the ENERGY_BUSINESS require the prediction of \
SOLAR_ENERGY (radiation) from a few seconds up to one week in advance. to \
deal with PREDICTION_SHORTCOMINGS, \
VARIOUS_SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION_METHODS have been used. \
PREDICTIVE_DATA_MINING offers variety of methods for \
SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTIONS where ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK is one of the \
reliable and ACCURATE_METHODS. a SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW of literature was \
conducted and identified 24 papers that discuss ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK \
for SOLAR_SYSTEMS_DESIGN and SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION. the \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_TECHNIQUES were employed for designing \
SOLAR_SYSTEMS and predicting SOLAR_RADIATIONS to assess \
CURRENT_LITERATURE on the basis of PREDICTION_ACCURACY and inadequacies. \
SPECIFIC_INCLUSION and EXCLUSION_CRITERIA in two DISTINCT_ROUNDS were \
applied to determine the most RELEVANT_STUDIES for our RESEARCH_GOAL. \
further, it is observed from the result of this study that \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK gives GOOD_ACCURACY in terms of \
PREDICTION_ERROR less than 20%. the accuracy of \
SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION_MODELS is found to be dependent on \
INPUT_PARAMETERS and ARCHITECTURE_TYPE_ALGORITHMS utilized. therefore, \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK as compared to other EMPIRICAL_MODELS is \
capable to deal with many input METEOROLOGICAL_PARAMETERS, which make it \
more accurate and reliable.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

Title: FUZZY_LOGIC_CONTROL of STAND_ALONE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM with \
BATTERY_STORAGE
Abstract:
```
PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY has nowadays an increased importance in \
ELECTRICAL_POWER_APPLICATIONS, since it is considered as an essentially \
inexhaustible and broadly AVAILABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCE. however, the \
OUTPUT_POWER provided via the PHOTOVOLTAIC_CONVERSION_PROCESS depends on \
SOLAR_IRRADIATION and temperature. therefore, to maximize the efficiency \
of the PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_SYSTEM, it is necessary to track the \
MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT of the PV_ARRAY. the PRESENT_PAPER proposes a \
MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT_TRACKER (mppt) method, based on \
FUZZY_LOGIC_CONTROLLER (flc), applied to a \
STAND_ALONE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM. it uses a sampling measure of the \
PV_ARRAY_POWER and voltage then determines an OPTIMAL_INCREMENT required \
to have the optimal OPERATING_VOLTAGE which permits \
MAXIMUM_POWER_TRACKING. this method carries HIGH_ACCURACY around the \
OPTIMUM_POINT when compared to the conventional one. the \
STAND_ALONE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM used in this paper includes two bi \
directional dc/dc converters and a lead acid battery bank to overcome the \
SCARE_PERIODS. one converter works as an MPP_TRACKER, while the other \
regulates the BATTERIES_STATE of charge and compensates the POWER_DEFICIT \
to provide a CONTINUOUS_DELIVERY of energy to the load. the obtained \
SIMULATION_RESULTS show the effectiveness of the proposed \
FUZZY_LOGIC_CONTROLLER.  2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.

Title: how to OPTIMIZE_MATERIALS and devices via DESIGN_OF_EXPERIMENTS and \
MACHINE_LEARNING: demonstration using ORGANIC_PHOTOVOLTAICS
Abstract:
```
most discoveries in MATERIALS_SCIENCE have been made empirically, \
typically through ONE_VARIABLE_AT_A_TIME (edisonian) experimentation. the \
characteristics of materials based systems are, however, neither simple \
nor uncorrelated. in a device such as an ORGANIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC, for \
example, the level of complexity is high due to the SHEER_NUMBER of \
components and PROCESSING_CONDITIONS, and thus, changing one variable can \
have MULTIPLE_UNFORESEEN effects due to their INTERCONNECTIVITY. \
DESIGN_OF_EXPERIMENTS (doe) is ideally suited for \
SUCH_MULTIVARIABLE_ANALYSES: by planning one's experiments as per the \
principles of doe, one can test and optimize SEVERAL_VARIABLES \
simultaneously, thus accelerating the process of discovery and \
optimization while saving time and PRECIOUS_LABORATORY_RESOURCES. when \
combined with MACHINE_LEARNING, the consideration of one's data in this \
manner provides a DIFFERENT_PERSPECTIVE for optimization and discovery, \
akin to CLIMBING out of a NARROW_VALLEY of serial \
(ONE_VARIABLE_AT_A_TIME) experimentation, to a MOUNTAIN_RIDGE with a 360 \

Title: DETERMINATION_METHOD of INSOLATION_PREDICTION with fuzzy and applying \
NEURAL_NETWORK for long term ahead PV_POWER_OUTPUT_CORRECTION
Abstract:
```
in RECENT_YEARS, introduction of an ALTERNATIVE_ENERGY_SOURCE such as \
SOLAR_ENERGY is expected. however, insolation is not constant and the \
output of a photovoltaic (pv) system is influenced by \
METEOROLOGICAL_CONDITIONS. in order to predict the POWER_OUTPUT for \
PV_SYSTEMS as accurately as possible, an INSOLATION_ESTIMATION_METHOD is \
required. this paper proposes the POWER_OUTPUT forecasting of a PV_SYSTEM \
based on insolation forecasting at 24 hours ahead by using \
WEATHER_REPORTED_DATA, FUZZY_THEORY, and NEURAL_NETWORK (nn). if the \
SUITABLE_TRAINING_DATA is not selected, the training process of nn tends \
to be unstable. the proposed technique for application of nn is trained \
by POWER_OUTPUT_DATA based on FUZZY_THEORY and WEATHER_REPORTED_DATA. \
since the FUZZY_MODEL_DETERMINES the insolation forecast data, nn will \
train the POWER_OUTPUT smoothly. the validity of the proposed method is \
confirmed by comparing the forecasting abilities on the \
COMPUTER_SIMULATIONS.  2010 2012 ieee.

Abstract:
```
among the DIFFERENT_FORMS of CLEAN_ENERGIES, solar energy has attracted a \
lot of attention because it is not only sustainable, but also is \
renewable and this means that we will never run out of it but the \
potential of using this form of renewable energy depends on its \
accessibility. due to the fact that the number of meteorological stations \
where GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION (gsr) is recorded, is limited in iran we \
were meant to develop four DISTINCTIVE_MODELS based on \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in order to prognosticate gsr in TEHRAN_PROVINCE, \
iran. accordingly, the polynomial and radial basis function (rbf) are \
applied as the kernel function of support vector regression (svr) and \
input energies from DIFFERENT_METEOROLOGICAL_DATA obtained from the only \
station in the studied region were selected as the inputs of the model \
and the gsr was chosen as the output of the models. instead of minimizing \
the observed TRAINING_ERROR, svr poly and svr rbf attempt to minimize the \
GENERALIZATION_ERROR bound so as to achieve generalized performance. the \
EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS show that an improvement in predictive accuracy and \
capability of generalization can be achieved by the proposed approach. \
the calculated root mean square error and CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT \
disclosed that svr  rbf performed well in predicting gsr. comparing svr \

Title: ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE based maximum power point tracking controllers \
for PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS: comparative study
Abstract:
```
in photovoltaic (pv) systems, maximum power point tracking (mppt) is an \
indispensable task. to date, VARIOUS_MPPT_TECHNIQUES have been proposed \
in the literature using classical and ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_METHODS. \
however, those techniques are tested on different pv systems and under \
different environmental conditions. in this work, we attempt to summarize \
and to give a comprehensive comparative study of the most adopted \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) based mppt techniques. the mppt techniques \
which will be described are based on: proportional integral derivative \
(pid), fuzzy logic (fl), ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann), genetic \
algorithms (ga) and particle SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso). the developed mppt \
controllers are tested under the same WEATHER_PROFILE in the same \
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM which is composed of a PV_MODULE, a dc dc buck boost \
converter and a dc load. initially, modelling and simulation of the \
system is performed using the matlab/simulink environment. thereafter, \
the SLIDING_MODE_CONTROL is applied to the converter in order to improve \
its performance. in a further stage, the different steps of development \
for each mppt technique are presented. simulation is performed to confirm \
the validity of the proposed controllers under the same \
VARIABLE_TEMPERATURE and SOLAR_IRRADIANCE_CONDITIONS. finally, a \
comparative study is carried out in order to evaluate the developed \
techniques regarding two PRINCIPAL_CRITERIA: the performance and the \
implementation cost. the performance is evaluated using comparative \
analysis of the tracking speed, the average tracking error, the variance \
and the efficiency. to estimate the implementation cost, a classification \
is carried out according to the type of the used sensors, the type of \
circuitry and the SOFTWARE_LEVEL_COMPLEXITY. recommendations that \
expected to be useful for researchers in the mppt area about the validity \
of each mppt technique are given in the last section.  2016 elsevier ltd

Title: a COMPARATIVE_EVALUATION for identifying the suitability of \
EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE to predict HORIZONTAL_GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION
Abstract:
```
in this paper, the EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE (elm) is employed to predict \
HORIZONTAL_GLOBAL_SOLAR_RADIATION (hgsr). for this purpose, the \
capability of developed ELM_METHOD is appraised statistically for \
PREDICTION of monthly mean daily hgsr using three DIFFERENT_TYPES of \
INPUT_PARAMETERS: (1) sunshine duration based (sdb), (2) difference \
temperature based (tb) and (3) MULTIPLE_PARAMETERS based (mpb). the long \
term measured data sets collected for city of shiraz situated in the \
FARS_PROVINCE of iran have been utilized as a CASE_STUDY. the predicted \
hgsr via elm is compared with those of SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE (svm), \
GENETIC_PROGRAMMING (gp) and ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) to ensure \
the precision of elm. it is found that higher accuracy can be obtained by \
MULTIPLE_PARAMETERS based estimation of hgsr using all techniques. the \
COMPUTATIONAL_RESULTS prove that elm is highly accurate and reliable and \
shows higher performance than svm, gp and ann. for MULTIPLE_PARAMETERS \
based ELM_MODEL, the mean ABSOLUTE_PERCENTAGE_ERROR, mean \
ABSOLUTE_BIAS_ERROR, root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR, RELATIVE_ROOT \
MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR and coefficient of determination are obtained as \
2.2518%, 0.4343 mj/m2, 0.5882 mj/m2, 2.9757% and 0.9865, respectively. by \
conducting a further verification, it is found that the ELM_METHOD also \
offers HIGH_SUPERIORITY over four EMPIRICAL_MODELS established for this \
study and an INTELLIGENT_MODEL from the literature. in the \
FINAL_ANALYSIS, a PROPER_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS is performed to identify \
the influence of considered INPUT_ELEMENTS on HGSR_PREDICTION in which \
the results reveal the significance of APPROPRIATE_SELECTION of \
INPUT_PARAMETERS to boost the accuracy of HGSR_PREDICTION by the \

demand on the NON_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES such as FOSSIL_FUELS, oil, \
NATURAL_GAS, nuclear, and other sources. therefore, many researchers have \
sought to improve the performance of SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS via applying \
several METAHEURISTIC_METHODS such as PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso) \
which simulates the behavior of the FISH_SCHOOLS or BIRD_FLOCKS. pso has \
been used in DIFFERENT_APPLICATIONS including engineering, manufacturing, \
and medicine. the MAIN_PROCESS of the pso is to determine the \
OPTIMAL_POSITION for each particle inside the population. this is \
performed through updating the position using the velocity of each \
particle and the SHARED_INFORMATION between the particles. the aim of \
this paper is to provide a review on the PSOS_APPLICATIONS to improve the \
performance of SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS and to identify the RESEARCH_GAP for \
FUTURE_WORK. the LITERATURE_REVIEW used in this study indicates that the \
pso is a very PROMISING_METHOD to enhance the performance of \

Title: WIND_FARM_MICRO_SITING by GAUSSIAN_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION with \
LOCAL_SEARCH_STRATEGY
Abstract:
```
the micro siting of wind farms has recently attracted much attention due \
to the booming development of wind energy. the PAPER_AIMS to maximize the \
ELECTRICAL_POWER extracted from a WIND_FARM while satisfying the required \
distance between TURBINES for OPERATION_SAFETY. the micro siting problem \
is by nature a CONSTRAINED_OPTIMIZATION problem, in which the coupling of \
wake effects is strong and the number of POSITION_CONSTRAINTS between \
TURBINES is large. an improved \
GAUSSIAN_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM is proposed to optimize \
the positions of TURBINES in the CONTINUOUS_SPACE. to prevent the \
premature of the ALGORITHM, a LOCAL_SEARCH_STRATEGY based on \
DIFFERENTIAL_EVOLUTION is incorporated to search around the \
PROMISING_REGION achieved by the PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION. a simple \
feasibility based method is employed to compare the performance of \
DIFFERENT_SCHEMES. COMPREHENSIVE_SIMULATION_RESULTS demonstrate that the \
micro siting schemes obtained by the proposed ALGORITHM_INCREASE the \
POWER_GENERATION of the WIND_FARM. moreover, the EXECUTION_TIME of the \
ALGORITHM is significantly reduced, which is important especially for \
large scale wind farms.  2012 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: CHARACTERISATION of SI_CRYSTALLINE PV_MODULES by \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS
Abstract:
```
in the PHOTOVOLTAIC_FIELD, manufacturers provide ratings for PV_MODULES \
for conditions referred to as STANDARD_TEST_CONDITIONS (stc). however, \
these conditions rarely occur outdoors, so the usefulness and \
applicability of the indoors' CHARACTERISATION in \
STANDARD_TEST_CONDITIONS of PV_MODULES are a CONTROVERSIAL_ISSUE. \
therefore, to carry out PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENGINEERING well, a \
SUITABLE_CHARACTERISATION of PV_MODULE ELECTRICAL_BEHAVIOUR (v i curves) \
is necessary. the IDEA_RESEARCH_GROUP from JAEN_UNIVERSITY has developed \
a method based on ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns) to \
ELECTRICAL_CHARACTERISATION of PV_MODULES. an ann has been developed \
which is able to generate v i curves of SI_CRYSTALLINE PV_MODULES for any \
IRRADIANCE and MODULE_CELL_TEMPERATURE. the results show that the \
proposed ANN_INTRODUCES a GOOD_ACCURATE_PREDICTION for SI_CRYSTALLINE \
PV_MODULES' performance when compared with the MEASURED_VALUES.  2008 \

Abstract:
```
the first objective of this study is to determine the \
THEORETICAL_POTENTIAL of SOLAR_IRRADIATION in INDONESIA by using \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns) method. the second objective is to \
visualize the SOLAR_IRRADIATION by province as SOLAR_MAP for the entire \

that were obtained from NASA_DATABASE are used for training the \
NEURAL_NETWORKS and the data from 5 locations were used for testing the \
estimated values. the testing data were not used in the training of the \
network in order to give an indication of the performance of the system \
at UNKNOWN_LOCATIONS. in this study, the \

Title: FEATURE_SELECTION in MACHINE_LEARNING_PREDICTION_SYSTEMS for \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_FOCUSES on FEATURE_SELECTION_PROBLEMS that arise in \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS. FEATURE_SELECTION is an IMPORTANT_PROBLEM \
in MACHINE_LEARNING, both in classification and REGRESSION_PROBLEMS. in \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS, FEATURE_SELECTION appears related to \
PREDICTION_SYSTEMS in the most IMPORTANT_SOURCES such as WIND, solar and \
MARINE_RESOURCES. the objective of the paper is twofold: first, a review \
of the most IMPORTANT_PREDICTION_SYSTEMS for \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS involving FEATURE_SELECTION is carried out. \
analysis and discussion of different FEATURE_SELECTION_PROBLEMS in \
PREDICTION_SYSTEMS are considered. we show that WRAPPER_FSP_APPROACHES \
are those mostly used due to their higher performance. they include a \
diversity of algorithms, prevailing fast training approaches. the lack of \
an UNIFORM_FRAMEWORK for fsp and the diversity of tackled PROBLEMS_IMPEDE \
a SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT of the performance and properties of the applied \
methods. thus, the simultaneously use of several GLOBAL_SEARCH_MECHANISMS \
should be the preferred option. in a second part of the paper, we explore \
this possibility, by introducing a NOVEL_APPROACH for FEATURE_SELECTION \
based on a novel meta heuristic, the CORAL_REEFS_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM \
with SUBSTRATE_LAYER. this approach is able to combine \
DIFFERENT_SEARCH_MECHANISMS into a single algorithm, providing a \
GLOBAL_SEARCH_PROCEDURE of HIGH_QUALITY. we use an \
EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE for prediction within this NOVEL_APPROACH. the \
performance of the system is evaluated in a problem of WIND \
SPEED_PREDICTION from NUMERICAL_MODELS_INPUT, using real data from a \
WIND_FARM in spain, where comparison with \
ALTERNATIVE_REGRESSION_ALGORITHMS is carried out. improvements up to 20% \
in hourly and daily WIND SPEED_PREDICTION are obtained with the proposed \
SYSTEM_VERSUS the algorithms without the FEATURE_SELECTION_PROCESS \
considered.  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: estimating the DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION using a coupled \
SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE WAVELET_TRANSFORM model
Abstract:
```
DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION is a FUNDAMENTAL_PARAMETER highly required in \
several SOLAR_ENERGY_APPLICATIONS. despite its significance, \
DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION is not measured in many locations around the \
world due to technical and FISCAL_LIMITATIONS. on this account, \
determining the amount of DIFFUSE_RADIATION alternatively based upon \
precise and reliable estimating methods is indeed essential. in this \
paper, a coupled model is developed for estimating daily \
HORIZONTAL_DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION by integrating the \
SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE (svm) with WAVELET_TRANSFORM (wt) algorithm. to \
test the validity of the coupled svm wt method, daily measured global and \
DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION_DATA sets for city of kerman situated in a \
SUNNY_PART of iran are utilized. for the developed svm wt model, \
DIFFUSE_FRACTION (CLOUDINESS_INDEX) is correlated with CLEARNESS_INDEX as \
the only INPUT_PARAMETER. the suitability of svm wt is evaluated against \
RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_SVM (svm rbf), ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and \
a 3rd DEGREE_EMPIRICAL_MODEL established for this study. it is found that \
the estimated DIFFUSE_SOLAR_RADIATION_VALUES by the svm wt model are in \
FAVOURABLE_AGREEMENTS with measured data. according to the conducted \
STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS, the obtained mean ABSOLUTE_BIAS_ERROR, root \
MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR and CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT are 0.5757 mj/m2, 0.6940 \
mj/m2 and 0.9631, respectively. while for the svm rbf ranked next the \
attained values are 1.0877 mj/m2, 1.2583 mj/m2 and 0.8599, respectively. \
in fact, the STUDY_RESULTS indicate that svm wt is an EFFICIENT_METHOD \
which enjoys much higher precision than other models, especially the 3rd \
DEGREE_EMPIRICAL_MODEL.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

the growing HUMAN_POPULATION in this MODERN_SOCIETY hugely depends on the \
ENERGY to fulfill their day to day needs and activities. \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES, especially SOLAR_ENERGY, can satisfy the \
GLOBAL_POWER_DEMAND while reducing GLOBAL_WARMING caused by \
CONVENTIONAL_SOURCES. SOLAR_IRRADIANCE is an ESSENTIAL_COMPONENT in \
SOLAR_POWER_APPLICATIONS. the availability of SOLAR_IRRADIANCE is \

WEATHER_CLASSIFICATION, and PERFORMANCE_EVALUATION_METRICS, which also \
NEED_CONSIDERATION. the accurate FORECASTING of SOLAR_IRRADIANCE is of \
UTMOST_IMPORTANCE for the POWER_SYSTEM_DESIGNERS and GRID_OPERATORS for \
EFFICIENT_MANAGEMENT of SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS. the intermittent and non \
stationary nature of SOLAR_IRRADIANCE makes many existing statistical and \
MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES less competent in providing \
ACCURATE_PREDICTIONS. in this context, DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS have been \
proposed by several researchers to reduce the limitations of existing \
MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS and improve PREDICTION_ACCURACY. in this work, an \
extensive and COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of DEEP_LEARNING based \
SOLAR_IRRADIANCE FORECASTING models is presented. the effectiveness and \
efficacy of several DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS, including \
LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY, DEEP_BELIEF_NETWORK, ECHO_STATE_NETWORK, \
CONVOLUTION_NEURAL_NETWORK, etc. have been reviewed. the results obtained \
in the reported studies proved the superiority of DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS in \
solar FORECASTING applications. few researchers have proposed \
DEEP_HYBRID_MODELS to improve the PREDICTION_PERFORMANCE further. a study \
reported that the hybrid of cnn lstm can enhance the PREDICTION_ACCURACY \
by 3.62%, 25.29%, 34.66%, 37.37% and 26.20% over cnn, lstm, gru, rnn and \
dnn, respectively. overall, this paper offers PRELIMINARY_GUIDELINES for \

Title: ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and INTERNET_OF_THINGS to improve efficacy of \
diagnosis and REMOTE_SENSING of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS: challenges, \
recommendations and FUTURE_DIRECTIONS
Abstract:
```
currently, a HUGE_NUMBER of PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS have been installed \
worldwide and these plants should be carefully protected and supervised \
continually in order to be safe and reliable during their working \
lifetime. PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS are subject to DIFFERENT_TYPES of faults \
and failures, while AVAILABLE_FAULT_DETECTION_EQUIPMENT are mainly used \
to protect and isolate the PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS from some faults (such as \
ARC_FAULT, line to line, line to ground and GROUND_FAULTS). although a \
GOOD_NUMBER of INTERNATIONAL_STANDARDS (iec, nec, and ul) exists, \
UNDETECTABLE_FAULTS continue to create SERIOUS_PROBLEMS in \
PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS. thus, designing SMART_EQUIPMENT, including \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and INTERNET_OF_THINGS for REMOTE_SENSING and \
FAULT_DETECTION_AND_DIAGNOSIS of PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS, will considerably \
solve the shortcomings of existing methods and commercialized equipment. \
this paper presents an overview of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and \
INTERNET_OF_THINGS applications in PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS. this research \
presents also the most advanced algorithms such as machine and \
DEEP_LEARNING, in terms of COST_IMPLEMENTATION, complexity, accuracy, \
SOFTWARE_SUITABILITY, and feasibility of real time applications. the \
embedding of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and INTERNET_OF_THINGS techniques \
for FAULT_DETECTION_AND_DIAGNOSIS into SIMPLE_HARDWARE, such as low cost \
chips, may be economical and technically feasible for PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS \
located in REMOTE_AREAS, with costly and CHALLENGING_ACCESSIBILITY for \
maintenance. CHALLENGING_ISSUES, recommendations, and trends of these \
techniques will also be presented in this paper.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: using ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS to ESTIMATE_SOLAR_RADIATION in kuwait
Abstract:
```
it is an aim of the KUWAITI_GOVERNMENT to achieve more PENETRATION_LEVELS \
of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES into the NATIONAL_ELECTRIC_GRID. among the \
VARIOUS_AVAILABLE_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_ALTERNATIVES, SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION \
imposes itself as the most feasible and REASONABLE_SOLUTION for a \
GREENER_KUWAIT. in kuwait, hours of SUNSHINE_RANGE between 7 h per day in \
december and 11 per day in august. on average, there are about 3347 \
SUNSHINE_HOURS per year, which make it an IDEAL_PLACE for \
MASSIVE_SOLAR_ENERGY_GENERATION. this MASSIVE_POTENTIAL for SOLAR_ENERGY \
will reduce kuwait's dependency on oil and other FOSSIL_FUELS and lead to \
a more secure power supply, a modernized kuwaiti ELECTRIC_NETWORK, more \
JOB_VACANCIES, and a dramatically cleaner environment. it is essential to \
quantify the amounts of SOLAR_RADIATION recorded during the past few \
years and to make projections for the future. in this paper, a \
MODEL_FORECASTER for the DAILY_AVERAGE_SOLAR_RADIATION in kuwait has been \
developed. the forecasting model is based on ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS \
that are able to cope with NONLINEAR_DATA. ACTUAL_DATA from five \
DIFFERENT_KUWAITI_SITES were used as training/testing data while \
developing the model. the developed forecaster is intended to help \
COUNTRY_OFFICIALS, PROSPECTIVE_INVESTORS, and POWER_SYSTEM_ENGINEERS \
choose locations for SOLAR_INSTALLATION and assess the techno economic \
merits of large scale SOLAR_ENERGY integration.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

Abstract:
```
abstract this paper presents a NEW_DIGITAL MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT tracking \
CONTROL_SCHEME for a STANDALONE_PHOTOVOLTAIC (pv) system. it is built up \
on a SINGLE_INPUT FUZZY_LOGIC (siflc), and based on the \
CONSTANT_VOLTAGE_ALGORITHM. the SIFLC_GENERATES a DUTY_CYCLE (d) signal \
which is the control one for the dc dc BOOST_CONVERTER. the proposed \
SIFLC_PERFORMANCES will be compared to these of the well known \
p&O_ALGORITHM. a STABILITY_STUDY for the MAMDANI_SIFLC_CONTROLLERS is \
performed and proposed. the LYAPUNOV_METHOD is considered for the \
STABILITY_ANALYSIS of the proposed CONTROL_SYSTEMS. this MPPT_ALGORITHM \
is then experimentally implemented all around a dsp1104 for a real time \
driving. the obtained results show that the proposed siflc MPPT clearly \
succeeds to track the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT and shows a higher PERFORMANCE \
than REGULAR_MPPTS such as the p&O_ALGORITHM. results of the \
EXPERIMENTAL_TESTS also prove the validity and robustness of the proposed \

Abstract:
```
abstract this paper presents a hybrid method for GENERATOR_TORQUE_CONTROL \
in wind turbines. the GENERATOR_TORQUE_CONTROL is usually used in lower \

method, the WIND_TURBINE_GENERATOR_TORQUE is regulated using a \
proportional and integral (pi) controller. in order to tune the pi gains, \
a radial basis function (rbf) neural network is used. the optimal dataset \
to train this neural network is provided by the \

Title: BAYESIAN_NETWORK modelling for the WIND_ENERGY_INDUSTRY: an overview
Abstract:
```
WIND_ENERGY farms are moving into deeper and more REMOTE_WATERS to \
benefit from availability of more space for the installation of \
WIND_TURBINES as well as higher WIND speed for the production of \
electricity. WIND farm asset managers must ensure availability of \
ADEQUATE_POWER supply as well as RELIABILITY of WIND_TURBINES throughout \
their lifetime. the environmental conditions in deep waters often change \
very rapidly, and therefore the PERFORMANCE_METRICS used in different \
life cycle phases of a WIND_ENERGY_PROJECT will need to be updated on a \
frequent basis so as to ensure that the WIND_ENERGY_SYSTEMS operate at \
the highest RELIABILITY. for this reason, there is a crucial need for the \
WIND_ENERGY_INDUSTRY to adopt advanced computational tools/techniques \
that are capable of modelling the RISK_SCENARIOS in near real time as \
well as providing a prompt response to any emergency situation. \
BAYESIAN_NETWORK (bn) is a POPULAR_PROBABILISTIC_METHOD that can be used \
for SYSTEM_RELIABILITY modelling and decision making under uncertainty. \
this paper provides a SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW and evaluation of existing \
research on the use of bn models in the WIND_ENERGY_SECTOR. to conduct \
this literature review, all RELEVANT_DATABASES from inception to date \
were searched, and a total of 70 sources (including journal publications, \
conference proceedings, PHD_DISSERTATIONS, industry reports, best \
PRACTICE_DOCUMENTS and SOFTWARE_USER_GUIDES) which met the inclusion \
criteria were identified. our REVIEW_FINDINGS reveal that the \
applications of bns in the WIND_ENERGY_INDUSTRY are quite diverse, \
ranging from WIND_POWER and WEATHER_FORECASTING to RISK_MANAGEMENT, fault \
diagnosis and prognosis, STRUCTURAL_ANALYSIS, RELIABILITY_ASSESSMENT, and \
maintenance planning and updating. furthermore, a number of case studies \
are presented to illustrate the applicability of bns in practice. \
although the PAPER_DETAILS_INFORMATION applicable to the \
WIND_ENERGY_INDUSTRY, the knowledge gained can be transferred to many \
other sectors.  2020 elsevier ltd

Title: review of techniques based on ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS for the \
ELECTRICAL_CHARACTERIZATION of CONCENTRATOR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY
Abstract:
```
CONCENTRATOR_PHOTOVOLTAICS (cpv) is considered to be one of the most \
PROMISING_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_COMPONENTS that could lead to a reduction on \
the dependence on FOSSIL_FUELS. the aim of CPV_TECHNOLOGY is to lower the \
cost of the system by reducing the SEMICONDUCTOR_MATERIAL, and replacing \
it by CHEAP_OPTICAL_DEVICES that concentrate the light received from the \
sun on a small size solar cell. the ELECTRICAL_CHARACTERIZATION of \
devices based on this technology however, is inherently different and \
more complex than that of the TRADITIONAL_PV_DEVICES. due to the \
advantages offered by the ARTIFICIAL_NEURON_NETWORKS (anns) to solve \
complex and non linear problems, and the GREAT_LEVEL of complexity of \
electrical modelling of CPV_DEVICES, in RECENT_YEARS, several authors \
have applied a variety of anns to solve issues related to CPV_TECHNOLOGY. \
in this paper, a review of the anns developed to address VARIOUS_TOPICS \
related with both, low and HIGH_CONCENTRATOR_PHOTOVOLTAICS, is presented. \
moreover, a review of the ann based models to predict the \
MAIN_ENVIRONMENTAL_PARAMETERS that affect the performance of CPV_SYSTEMS \
operating outdoors is also provided. published papers presented show the \
potential of the anns as a POWERFUL_TOOL for modelling the \

Abstract:

recently, with ENERGY_CRISES and ENVIRONMENTAL_PROBLEMS becoming \
increasingly obvious, the utilization of WIND_POWER has become a \
BIG_CONCERN. meanwhile, the INCONSISTENT_RELATIONSHIP between china's \
economy and wind ENERGY_POTENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION has caused \
INEVITABLE_DIFFICULTIES in transportation of WIND_POWER and even in \

CONSIDERABLE_ATTENTION. weibull, rayleigh, gamma and \
LOGNORMAL_PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTIONS are evaluated. then three \
NUMERICAL_METHODS (nms)   method of moment (mm), \
MAXIMUM_LIKELIHOOD_ESTIMATION (mle), and least SQUARES_METHOD (lsm), are \
applied to get PARAMETER_ESTIMATION in the these distributions. \
additionally, another three \
COMPARISON_METAHEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS (moas), including \
BAT_ALGORITHM (BA), CUCKOO_SEARCH_ALGORITHM (CS) and \
PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (PSO) are employed as COMPARISON_METHODS to \
tune the OPTIMAL_PARAMETERS. EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS_CONCLUDE that in this \
CASE_MOAS perform better than nms. moreover, BA weibull, CS weibull, and \
PSO weibull with only a SLIGHT_DIFFERENCE_OUTPERFORM all of the other \
distributions. specifically, BA weibull and PSO weibull are only slightly \
superior to CS weibull. the AVERAGE_WIND_POWER_DENSITY, the \

CAPACITY_FACTOR of wind turbine are considered as KEY_DETERMINANT_FACTORS \
in assessing the LOW_SPEED wind ENERGY_POTENTIAL, which are directly \
influenced by the parameters in WEIBULL_MODEL. moreover, the \

Abstract:
```
SOLAR_POWER_FORECASTING will have a SIGNIFICANT_IMPACT on the future of \
large scale RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PLANTS. predicting \

which fluctuate over time. in this research, we propose a HYBRID_MODEL \
that combines MACHINE_LEARNING methods with theta STATISTICAL_METHOD for \
more ACCURATE_PREDICTION of FUTURE_SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION from \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PLANTS. the MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS include long short \
term memory (lstm), GATE_RECURRENT_UNIT (gru), AUTOENCODER_LSTM (auto \
lstm) and a newly proposed auto gru. to enhance the accuracy of the \
proposed MACHINE_LEARNING and STATISTICAL_HYBRID_MODEL (mlshm), we employ \
two DIVERSITY_TECHNIQUES, i.e. STRUCTURAL_DIVERSITY and DATA_DIVERSITY. \
to combine the prediction of the ENSEMBLE_MEMBERS in the proposed mlshm, \
we exploit four combining methods: simple averaging approach, weighted \
averaging using LINEAR_APPROACH and using non LINEAR_APPROACH, and \
combination through variance using INVERSE_APPROACH. the proposed \
MLSHM_SCHEME was validated on two real time series datasets, that \
SRE_SHAGAYA in kuwait and cocoa in the usa. the experiments show that the \
proposed mlshm, using all the COMBINATION_METHODS, achieved higher \
accuracy compared to the prediction of the TRADITIONAL_INDIVIDUAL_MODELS. \
results demonstrate that a HYBRID_MODEL combining MACHINE_LEARNING \
methods with STATISTICAL_METHOD outperformed a HYBRID_MODEL that only \
combines MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS without STATISTICAL_METHOD.  2019

Abstract:
```
the use of PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS for CLEAN_ELECTRICAL_ENERGY has \
increased. however, due to their LOW_EFFICIENCY, researchers have looked \
for ways to increase their effectiveness and improve their efficiency. \
the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT_TRACKING (mppt) inverters allow us to maximize \
the extraction of as much energy as possible from PV_PANELS, and they \
require algorithms to extract the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT (mpp). several \
INTELLIGENT_ALGORITHMS show ACCEPTABLE_PERFORMANCE; however, few consider \
using ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (ann). these have the advantage of \
giving a fast and accurate tracking of the mpp. the \
CONTROLLER_EFFECTIVENESS depends on the algorithm used in the hidden \
layer and how well the NEURAL_NETWORK has been trained. articles over the \
last six years were studied. a review of DIFFERENT_PAPERS, reports, and \
other documents using ann for MPPT_CONTROL is presented. the algorithms \
are based on ann or in a HYBRID_COMBINATION with fl or a \
METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHM. ANN_MPPT_ALGORITHMS deliver an \
AVERAGE_PERFORMANCE of 98% in UNIFORM_CONDITIONS, exhibit a faster \
CONVERGENCE_SPEED, and have fewer oscillations around the mpp, according \

Title: DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD_PREDICTION of grid interactive PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANT using \
RELIEF_ATTRIBUTE_EVALUATOR based RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_NEURAL_NETWORK
Abstract:
```
the progress of RENEWABLE_ENERGY is becoming an IMPORTANT_SOURCE for \
meeting ENERGY_REQUIREMENTS of india. with the PLENTIFUL_AVAILABILITY of \
SOLAR_ENERGY, grid interactive solar photovoltaic (gispv) plants are \
becoming important in most part of the country. due to varying \
CLIMATIC_CONDITION it is important to predict the DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD of \
GISPV_PLANT. in this paper, NEW_ALGORITHM_RELIEF_ATTRIBUTE_EVALUATOR is \
used to find most influencing variables from SOLAR_RADIATION (sr) and \
BACK_SURFACE_MODULE_TEMPERATURE (bsmt) to predict the DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD \
of 190 kwp gispv power plant using RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_NEURAL_NETWORK \
(rbfnn) for 26 DIFFERENT_INDIAN_CITIES. the ranks given by \
RELIEF_ATTRIBUTE_EVALUATOR are 0.00775 for sr and 0.00139 for bsmt, \
showing sr is RELEVANT_VARIABLES for DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD_PREDICTION. for \
analysis two RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_NEURAL_NETWORK (rbfnn 1, rbfnn 2) \
models are developed for the PREDICTION of DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD for the 190 \
kwp gispv power plant. sr and bsmt are used as INPUT_PARAMETERS for the \
rbfnn 1model and sr is used as input for the rbfnn 2 model. the root \
MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR (rmse) for rbfnn 1 is 0.2642 kwh/kwp/day and for rbfnn \
2 the rmse is 0.2910 kwh/kwp/day. the RESULTS_COMPARISON_SHOWS that \
RBFNN_PREDICTS DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD better than the \
POLYNOMIAL_REGRESSION_MODEL. the rbfnn 2 model is used to predict \
DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD for 26 DIFFERENT_INDIAN_CITIES and it is found that \
total daily average DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD varies from 3.50 kwh/kwp/day to \
7.94 kwh/kwp/day which can be used to ESTIMATE_POWER_PRODUCTION for \
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS. the predicted TOTAL_ARRAY_YIELD by rbfnn \
2 model is validated with calculated value and rmse is found to be 2.295 \
kwh/kwp/day showing rbfnn 2 can be used to predict DAILY_ARRAY_YIELD for \
DIFFERENT_SITES in india.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: DEEP_LEARNING based FAULT_DIAGNOSIS of PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS: a \
COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW and ENHANCEMENT_PROSPECTS
Abstract:
```
photovoltaic (pv) systems are subject to failures during their operation \
due to the aging effects and external/environmental conditions. these \
faults may affect the DIFFERENT_SYSTEM_COMPONENTS such as PV_MODULES, \
CONNECTION_LINES, converters/inverters, which can lead to a decrease in \
the EFFICIENCY, performance, and further SYSTEM_COLLAPSE. thus, a \
KEY_FACTOR to be taken into consideration in high EFFICIENCY grid \
connected PV_SYSTEMS is the FAULT_DETECTION_AND_DIAGNOSIS (fdd). the \
performance of the FDD_METHOD depends mainly on the quality of the \
extracted features including REAL_TIME_CHANGES, PHASE_CHANGES, \
TREND_CHANGES, and FAULTY_MODES. thus, the DATA_REPRESENTATION_LEARNING \
is the CORE_STAGE of INTELLIGENT_FDD_TECHNIQUES. recently, due to the \
enhancement of computing capabilities, the increase of the BIG_DATA_USE, \
and the development of EFFECTIVE_ALGORITHMS, the DEEP_LEARNING (dl) tool \
has witnessed a GREAT_SUCCESS in DATA_SCIENCE. therefore, this paper \
proposes an EXTENSIVE_REVIEW on DEEP_LEARNING based FDD_METHODS for \
PV_SYSTEMS. after a BRIEF_DESCRIPTION of the dl based strategies, \
techniques for diagnosing PV_SYSTEMS proposed in RECENT_LITERATURE are \
overviewed and analyzed to point out their differences, advantages and \
limits. FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS towards the improvement of the \
performance of the dl based FDD_TECHNIQUES are also discussed. this \
REVIEW_PAPER_AIMS to systematically present the development of dl based \
fdd for PV_SYSTEMS and provide guidelines for FUTURE_RESEARCH in the \
field.  2013 ieee.

Title: STATISTICAL_LEARNING_APPROACH for WIND_RESOURCE_ASSESSMENT
Abstract:
```
WIND_RESOURCE_ASSESSMENT is fundamental when selecting a site for wind \
ENERGY_PROJECTS. wind is influenced by several ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS and \
understanding its SPATIAL_VARIABILITY is key in determining the \
ECONOMIC_VIABILITY of a site. numerical wind FLOW_MODELS, which solve \
PHYSICAL_EQUATIONS that govern air flows, are the industry standard for \
WIND_RESOURCE_ASSESSMENT. these methods have been proven over the years \
to be able to estimate the WIND_RESOURCE with a relatively HIGH_ACCURACY. \
however, measuring stations, which provide the starting data for every \
WIND_ESTIMATION, are often located at some distance from each other, in \
some CASES_TENS of kilometres or more. this adds an UNAVOIDABLE_AMOUNT of \
UNCERTAINTY to the estimations, which can be difficult and time consuming \
to calculate with numerical wind FLOW_MODELS. for this reason, even \
though there are ways of computing the OVERALL_ERROR of the estimations, \
methods based on physics fail to provide planners with detailed \
SPATIAL_REPRESENTATIONS of the UNCERTAINTY_PATTERN. in this paper we \
introduce a STATISTICAL_METHOD for estimating the WIND_RESOURCE, based on \
STATISTICAL_LEARNING. in particular, we present an approach based on \
ensembles of REGRESSION_TREES, to estimate the WIND_SPEED and \
DIRECTION_DISTRIBUTIONS continuously over the united kingdom (uk), and \
provide planners with a detailed account of the SPATIAL_PATTERN of the \
WIND_MAP_UNCERTAINTY.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

in the CURRENT_ERA, ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) is becoming increasingly \
pervasive with applications in several APPLICATIVE_FIELDS effectively \
changing our DAILY_LIFE. in this scenario, MACHINE_LEARNING (ml), a \
subset of AI_TECHNIQUES, provides machines with the ability to \
programmatically learn from data to model a system while adapting to \
NEW_SITUATIONS as they learn more by data they are ingesting (on line \
training). during the last several years, many papers have been published \
concerning ML_APPLICATIONS in the field of SOLAR_SYSTEMS. this paper \
presents the state of the ART_ML_MODELS applied in SOLAR_ENERGYS \
forecasting field i.e., for SOLAR_IRRADIANCE and POWER_PRODUCTION \
forecasting (both point and interval or probabilistic forecasting), \
ELECTRICITY_PRICE forecasting and ENERGY_DEMAND forecasting. other \
applications of ml into the photovoltaic (pv) field taken into account \
are the modelling of PV_MODULES, PV_DESIGN_PARAMETER_EXTRACTION, tracking \
the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT (mpp), PV_SYSTEMS_EFFICIENCY_OPTIMIZATION, \

Title: estimation of hourly GLOBAL_SOLAR_IRRADIATION on tilted absorbers from \
horizontal one using ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK for CASE_STUDY of MASHHAD
Abstract:
```
today, for providing CLEAN_ENERGY, solar capturing facilities such as \
PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS (pv) or SOLAR_THERMAL_COLLECTORS (scts) have been \
increasingly installed worldwide. on the other side, lack of \
SOLAR_RADIATION_DATA is one of the barriers for developing these \
technologies locally. short time step calculation of solar \
GLOBAL_IRRADIATION (sgi) on INCLINED_PLANES is required regarding to \
predict PRECISE_PERFORMANCE of SOLAR_SYSTEMS, leading to enhance security \
operation's conditions and ECONOMIC_COST saving. moreover, SGI_VALUES on \
tilted absorbers have a NONLINEAR_RELATIONSHIP with several variables \
such as HORIZONTAL_SOLAR GLOBAL_IRRADIATION, EXTRATERRESTRIAL_HORIZONTAL \
GLOBAL_IRRADIATION, and number of days, COLLECTOR_ANGLE, \
SOLAR_ALTITUDE_ANGLE and the latitude of the location. thus computation \
of sgi is neither readily to obtain nor easy to forecast. this paper is \
proposed on estimating ACCURATE_VALUES of sgi on tilted planes via \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann). indeed, anns are EFFECTIVE_TOOLS to \
MODEL_NONLINEAR_SYSTEMS and are widely used SIMULATION_SOFTWARE \
incorporated in MATLAB. MASHHAD the second megacity of iran is taken into \
account for the CASE_STUDY. the ann is developed and optimized using \
every 30 min of SGI_DATA (6.00 am until 5.00 pm) in 2013 on zero, 45 and \
60 INCLINED_PLANES respectively. these data have been gauged by \
pyranometers which are installed in air & SOLAR_INSTITUTE of \
FERDOWSI_UNIVERSITY of MASHHAD. meanwhile, the accuracies including r2 \
(CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT), mae (mean ABSOLUTE_ERROR) and rmse (root \
MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR) are obtained 0.9242, 0.0284, 0.055 and 0.9302, 0.0269, \
0.0549 for 60 and 45 tilted collectors respectively. eventually it is \
concluded that ann can be a RELIABLE_NETWORK and well capable for \
FORECASTING SOLAR_ENERGY on SLOPE_SOLAR_ABSORBERS in MASHHAD.  2015 \

depends on its coverage of large sizes of data and parameters, which have \
to be investigated thoroughly. this paper covered the most resent and \
important researchers in the domain of RENEWABLE_PROBLEMS using the \
learning based methods. VARIOUS_TYPES of deep learning (dl) and machine \
learning (ml) algorithms employed in solar and WIND_ENERGY supplies are \
given. the performance of the given methods in the literature is assessed \
by a new taxonomy. this paper focus on conducting comprehensive state of \
the art methods heading to performance evaluation of the given techniques \
and discusses VITAL_DIFFICULTIES and possibilities for extensive \
research. based on the results, variations in efficiency, robustness, \
ACCURACY_VALUES, and generalization capability are the most obvious \
difficulties for using the learning techniques. in the case of the big \
dataset, the effectiveness of the learning techniques is significantly \
better than the other computational methods. however, applying and \
producing hybrid learning techniques with other optimization methods to \
develop and optimize the construction of the techniques is optionally \
indicated. in all cases, hybrid learning methods have better achievement \
than a single method due to the fact that hybrid methods gain the benefit \
of two or more techniques for providing an accurate forecast. therefore, \
it is suggested to UTILIZE_HYBRID_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES in the future to \

Title: PARAMETERS_OPTIMIZATION of solar pv cell/module using GENETIC_ALGORITHM \
based on NON_UNIFORM_MUTATION
Abstract:
```
extracting the OPTIMUM_PARAMETERS of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (pv) model using \
the EXPERIMENTAL_DATA of currentvoltage is very critical in simulating, \
controlling, and optimizing the PV_SYSTEMS. one of the IMPORTANT_PROBLEMS \
encountered in modeling and simulating is to find a model that can \
EXTRACT_PARAMETERS from PV_MODELS quickly, accurately, and reliably. \
based on this motivation, the goal of this study is to suggest an \
improved algorithm, namely GENETIC_ALGORITHM based on \
NON_UNIFORM_MUTATION (gamnu), in order to approximate efficiently the \
parameters of SOLAR_CELLS and PV_MODULES. in gamnu, NON_UNIFORM_MUTATION \
operator is used to maintain diversity in the explored solutions and the \
CROSSOVER_OPERATOR follows an ADAPTIVE_SEARCH_STRATEGY, which consists of \
searching the ENTIRE_SPACE at the beginning while maintaining a focused \
search when the POPULATION_TENDS to converge in a CERTAIN_REGION of the \
SEARCH_SPACE. the performance of the method is comprehensively evaluated \
on DIFFERENT_SOLAR_CELL_MODELS, including single and DOUBLE_DIODE, and \
single DIODE_PV_MODULES, of a r.t.c france silicon solar cell, esp 160 \
ppw pv, stp6 120/36 and photowatt pwp201 module. the results obtained \
from single and DOUBLE_DIODE_MODELS for r.t.c france are respectively \
9.861810 4 and 9.868310 4, and for photowatt pwp201, stp6 120/36 and esp \
160 ppw are 2.382410 3 2.38242023090010 3, 1.673510 21.673578650508510 2 \
and 8.294210 2 8.294210 2. the statistical obtained results show that the \
proposed method has very COMPETITIVE_PERFORMANCE in terms of accuracy and \
reliability when compared to other advanced algorithms. therefore, the \
proposed algorithm is highly useful to extract the parameters of \
SOLAR_PV_MODELS.  2021 the author(s)

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING_ROADMAP for PEROVSKITE_PHOTOVOLTAICS
Abstract:
```
PEROVSKITE_SOLAR_CELLS (psc) are a FAVORABLE_CANDIDATE for next \
generation solar systems with efficiencies comparable to \
SI_PHOTOVOLTAICS, but their LONG_TERM_STABILITY must be proven prior to \
commercialization. however, traditional trial and error approaches to psc \
screening, development, and STABILITY_TESTING are slow and \
LABOR_INTENSIVE. in this perspective, we present a survey of how \
MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) and AUTONOMOUS_EXPERIMENTATION provide \
ADDITIONAL_TOOLKITS to gain PHYSICAL_UNDERSTANDING while accelerating \
PRACTICAL_DEVICE_ADVANCEMENT. we propose a roadmap for applying ml to \
PSC_RESEARCH at all stages of design (COMPOSITIONAL_SELECTION, \
PEROVSKITE_MATERIAL_SYNTHESIS and testing, and FULL_DEVICE_EVALUATION). \
we also provide an overview of RELEVANT_CONCEPTS and BASELINE_MODELS that \
apply ml to DIVERSE_MATERIALS_PROBLEMS, demonstrating its BROAD_RELEVANCE \
while highlighting PROMISING_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS and associated \
challenges. finally, we discuss our outlook for an integrated pipeline \
that encompasses all DESIGN_STAGES and presents a path to \
commercialization.   2021 AMERICAN_CHEMICAL_SOCIETY.

Abstract:
```
the use of INTELLIGENT_ALGORITHMS for GLOBAL_SOLAR_PREDICTION is an \
IDEAL_TOOL for research focused on the use of SOLAR_ENERGY. forecasting \
SOLAR_RADIATION_SUPPORTS DIFFERENT_APPLICATIONS focused on the generation \
and transport of energy in places where there are no \
METEOROLOGICAL_STATIONS. DIFFERENT_SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION_TECHNIQUES \
have been applied in DIFFERENT_TIME_HORIZONS, such as NEURAL_NETWORKS \
(ann) or MACHINE_LEARNING (ml), with the latter being the most important. \
the SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE (svm) is a CLASSIFICATION_METHOD of the ml \
that is used to predict SOLAR_RADIATION. to obtain a better accuracy of \
PREDICTION_DATA, SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS (soa) such as \
GENETIC_ALGORITHMS (ga) and the PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM \
(pso) were used to optimize the PREDICTION_ACCURACY by searching the \
MODEL_PARAMETERS. this article presents a review of \
DIFFERENT_HYBRID_SVM_MODELS with soa applied to obtain the best \
parameters to reduce the PREDICTION_ERROR of SOLAR_RADIATION using \
METEOROLOGICAL_VARIABLES. RESEARCH_ARTICLES from the last 5 years on \
SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION using SVM_MODELS and HYBRID_SMV optimized \
models with soa were studied. the results show that svm with ga presents \
a better performance than the CLASSICAL_SVM_MODELS using the \

between performance in PREDICTION_PROBLEMS and their \
COMPUTATIONAL_EFFICIENCY. the use of these models for PREDICTION_PROBLEMS \
related to RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES has been particularly notable in \
RECENT_TIMES, including DIFFERENT_WAYS in which randomization is \
considered, their hybridization with other modeling techniques and/or \
their multi layered (deep) and ENSEMBLE_ARRANGEMENT. this manuscript \
comprehensively reviews the most IMPORTANT_FEATURES of randomization \
based MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS, and critically examines RECENT_EVIDENCES \
of their application to RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PREDICTION_PROBLEMS, focusing on \
those related to solar, WIND, marine/ocean and HYDRO_POWER \
RENEWABLE_SOURCES. our study of the literature is complemented by an \

dealing with SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION, WIND SPEED_PREDICTION in WIND \
farms and HYDRO_POWER energy. in all these problems randomization based \
methods are reported to achieve a better PREDICTIVE_PERFORMANCE than \
their corresponding state of the art solutions, while demanding a \
dramatically lower COMPUTATIONAL_EFFORT for its LEARNING_PHASES. finally, \
we pause and reflect on important challenges faced by these methods when \
applied to RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PREDICTION_PROBLEMS, such as their \
INTRINSIC_EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTY, or the need for explainability. we also \

Title: meta heuristic optimization techniques used for MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT \

Abstract:
```
a CRITICAL_ADVANCEMENT in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (pv) establishment has led \
to ROBUST_ACCELERATION towards the evolution of new mppt techniques. the \
sun oriented PV_FRAMEWORK has a non linear characteristic in varying \
CLIMATIC_CONDITIONS, which considerably impact the PV_FRAMEWORK_YIELD. \
furthermore, the partial shading condition (psc) causes MAJOR_PROBLEMS, \
such as a drop in the output power yield and multiple peaks in the \
PV_ATTRIBUTE. hence, following the GLOBAL_MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT (gmpp) \
under psc is a demanding problem. subsequently, \
DIFFERENT_MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT tracking (mppt) strategies have been \
utilized to improve the yield of a PV_FRAMEWORK. however, the disarray \
lies in choosing the best mppt technique from the WIDE_ALGORITHMS for a \
particular purpose. each algorithm has its benefits and drawbacks. hence, \
there is a FUNDAMENTAL_NEED for an APPROPRIATE_AUDIT of the mppt \
strategies from time to time. this article presents new works done in the \
GLOBAL_POWER_POINT tracking (gmppt) ALGORITHM_FIELD under the pscs. it \
sums up DIFFERENT_MPPT_STRATEGIES alongside their working principle, \
MATHEMATICAL_REPRESENTATION, and FLOW_CHARTS. moreover, tables depicted \
in this study briefly organize the SIGNIFICANT_ATTRIBUTES of algorithms. \

the demands for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION are progressively expanding \

NOVEL_STRATEGY. the efficient modeling of PV_CELLS and \
ACCURATE_PARAMETER_ESTIMATION is becoming more significant for the \

for the PARAMETER_VALUATION of PV_SYSTEMS. PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION \
(pso) is a METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHM inspired by ANIMAL_BEHAVIOR. pso and \
DERIVATIVE_ALGORITHMS are EFFICIENT_METHODS to tackle \
DIFFERENT_OPTIMIZATION_ISSUES. HYBRID_PSO_ALGORITHMS were developed to \
improve the performance of BASIC_ONES. this review presents a \
COMPREHENSIVE_INVESTIGATION of HYBRID_PSO_ALGORITHMS for the \
PARAMETER_ASSESSMENT of PV_CELLS. this paper presents how much work is \
conducted in this field, and how much work can additionally be performed \
to improve this strategy and create more IDEAL_ARRANGEMENTS of an issue. \
algorithms are compared on the basis of the used OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION, type \
of DIODE_MODEL, IRRADIATION_CONDITIONS, and types of panels. more \
importantly, the QUALITATIVE_ANALYSIS of algorithms is performed on the \
basis of COMPUTATIONAL_TIME, COMPUTATIONAL_COMPLEXITY, CONVERGENCE_RATE, \

Title: a state of the art review on shading mitigation techniques in \
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS via meta heuristic approach
Abstract:
```
to enhance the production of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (spv) based cleaner \
energy, the maximum power point (mpp) tracking (mppt) schemes are \
utilized. to ensure a reliable and effective mpp extraction from \
SPV_SYSTEMS, the exploitation and implementation of different mppt \
schemes are of great significance. this article intends to present a \
rigorous and comprehensive review of mppt schemes in SPV_SYSTEMS under \
partial shading (ps) conditions based on a meta heuristic approach and \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann). in RECENT_YEARS, modern optimization \
based global mpp (gmpp) extraction schemes are gaining much attention \
from researchers. in this REVIEW_ARTICLE, thirteen modern optimizations \
and ann based gmpp tracking techniques are vividly described with their \
flowchart and detailed mathematical modeling. this WORK_ASSESSES all the \
schemes according to parameters like tracking efficacy, tracking time, \
application, sensed parameters, converter utilized, steady state \
oscillations, experimental setup, and key notes. based on the \
RIGOROUS_REVIEW, a novel gmpp extraction scheme based on a recently \
introduced meta heuristic approach named \
ARTIFICIAL_GORILLA_TROOPS_OPTIMIZER is proposed. this REVIEW_WORK serves \
as a source of comprehensive information about applying these mppt \
techniques to extract gmpp from the SPV_SYSTEM under PS_CONDITIONS; \
furthermore, it can be considered a one stop handbook for further study \
in this field.  2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer \

Title: META_HEURISTICS OPTIMIZATION in ELECTRIC_VEHICLES  an EXTENSIVE_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
OPTIMIZATION through META_HEURISTICS in electric vehicular (ev) transport \
has emerged as the key to improve the existing technologies and PAVE_WAY \
for their MASS_DEPLOYMENT and revolutionize the CURRENT_TRANSPORT_SYSTEM \
while lowering GREENHOUSE_EMISSIONS. range and cost have been the \
MAIN_ASPECTS that continue to hinder the development of evs. this paper \
provides a COMPREHENSIVE_OUTLOOK of the five MAJOR_AREAS of OPTIMIZATION \
(over the last two decades) in evs i.e., DESIGN_OPTIMIZATION, \
ENERGY_MANAGEMENT, OPTIMAL_CONTROL, optimized CHARGING/discharging and \

Title: modelling community scale RENEWABLE_ENERGY and \
ELECTRIC_VEHICLE_MANAGEMENT for cold CLIMATE_REGIONS using \
MACHINE_LEARNING
Abstract:
```
with increasing ENVIRONMENTAL_PROBLEMS of fossil fuel based devices and \
systems in societies, diffusion and adoption of SUSTAINABILITY_SOLUTIONS \
such as RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES and hybrid/ELECTRIC_VEHICLES have \
increased in the residential and COMMERCIAL_SECTORS. however, \
ENERGY_DEMAND in the buildings and ENERGY supply from RENEWABLES are \
complex, dynamic, and non linear. this COMPLEXITY_SHOWS itself in cold \
CLIMATE_REGIONS that the supply of required ENERGY from RENEWABLES is \
along with uncertainties and even sometimes stochastic. this \
PAPER_ASSESSES the ENERGY supply/demand performance of a group of \
RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS in a community in a cold climate region, st. \
albert, canada. first, all the buildings of the community are modeled and \
the required ENERGY to respond to the demand and ELECTRIC_VEHICLES are \
calculated. then, the potential of each building for electricity supply \
via PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS is calculated. finally, the ENERGY supply/demand \
management of the COMMUNITY_IS assessed using a MACHINE_LEARNING_TOOL. \
the results show that the COMMUNITY_PEAK HEATING and cooling loads are \
420 kw and 121 kw, respectively and the total ANNUAL_ENERGY_PRODUCTION \
from PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM is 14,203 kwh for a single house. regarding the \
ELECTRIC_VEHICLE_LOAD, the PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM can provide 29.23% of the \
community's total load, annually. finally by comparing the modeled \
pattern and the predicted pattern, an accuracy of 88.6% is obtained for \
the prediction.  2022 the author(s)

Title: an analysis of WIND_SPEED_PREDICTION using ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS: a \
CASE_STUDY in manjil, iran
Abstract:
```
in this study, AIR_TEMPERATURE, RELATIVE_HUMIDITY, and \
VAPOR_PRESSURE_DATA collected from MANJIL_STATION between 1993 2004, were \
used for WIND_SPEED predictions in a FUTURE_TIME_DOMAIN using \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS. the following combinations of data are \
considered for this study: (i) month of the year, monthly mean daily \
AIR_TEMPERATURE, and RELATIVE_HUMIDITY as inputs, and monthly mean daily \
WIND_SPEED as output; (ii) month of the year, monthly mean daily \
AIR_TEMPERATURE, RELATIVE_HUMIDITY, and VAPOR_PRESSURE as inputs, and \
monthly mean daily WIND_SPEED as output. the \
GENERALIZED_REGRESSION_NEURAL_NETWORKS, MULTILAYER_PERCEPTRON, and \
RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTION_NEURAL_NETWORKS were used in this study. the \
MEASURED_DATA between 1993 and 2003 is applied for training and the data \
for 2004 is used for testing. the data for testing were not applied for \
training the NEURAL_NETWORKS. obtained results show that NEURAL_NETWORKS \
are well capable of estimating WIND_SPEED from \
SIMPLE_METEOROLOGICAL_DATA. these results indicate that using \
VAPOR_PRESSURE along with the month of the year, monthly mean daily \
AIR_TEMPERATURE, and RELATIVE_HUMIDITY based on a \
MULTILAYER_PERCEPTRON_NETWORK has better performance than the other cases \
with the MEAN_ABSOLUTE_PERCENTAGE_ERROR of 7.03% (2004).  2012 \

PROFITABLE_OFFSHORE WIND_ENERGY_PRODUCTION. today, RAI_APPLICATIONS are \
predominately being used to support SHORT_TERM_OBJECTIVES in operation \
and maintenance. however, moving forward, rai has the potential to play a \
CRITICAL_ROLE throughout the FULL_LIFECYCLE of offshore wind \
infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, \
OPERATIONAL_SUPPORT, training and decommissioning. this paper presents \
one of the first SYSTEMATIC_REVIEWS of rai for the \

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING as an ONLINE_DIAGNOSTIC_TOOL for proton exchange \

Abstract:
```
proton exchange membrane fuel cells are considered a PROMISING_POWER \
supply system with HIGH_EFFICIENCY and ZERO_EMISSIONS. they typically \
work within a relatively NARROW_RANGE of temperature and humidity to \
achieve OPTIMAL_PERFORMANCE; however, this makes the system difficult to \
control, leading to faults and accelerated degradation. two \
MAIN_APPROACHES can be used for diagnosis, limited DATA_INPUT which \
provides an unintrusive, rapid but limited analysis, or advanced \
characterisation that provides a more ACCURATE_DIAGNOSIS but often \
requires invasive or SLOW_MEASUREMENTS. to provide an ACCURATE_DIAGNOSIS \
with RAPID_DATA_ACQUISITION, MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS have shown \
GREAT_POTENTIAL. however, there is a BROAD_APPROACH to the \
DIAGNOSTIC_ALGORITHMS and signals used in the field. this article \

Title: SOLAR_RADIATION and SOLAR_ENERGY_ESTIMATION using ann and \
FUZZY_LOGIC_CONCEPT: a comprehensive and SYSTEMATIC_STUDY
Abstract:
```
to overcome the need of the world for ENERGY_CONSUMPTION, we have to find \
some better and STABLE_ALTERNATE_WAYS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY with advanced \
technology. the most readily AVAILABLE_SOURCE of energy is SOLAR_ENERGY \
but SOLAR_ENERGY has NONLINEAR_NATURE due to the RANDOM_NATURE of \
CLIMATE_CONDITIONS. so, one way to solve is SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION \
and SOLAR_ENERGY_PREDICTION using more ACCURATE_TECHNIQUES. also, \
ENERGY_BUSINESS and POWER_SYSTEM_CONTROL_UNITS require more accuracy \
along with very short to LARGE_DURATION_PREDICTION in advance. so, to \
complete the requirement many PREDICTION_TECHNIQUES are used and among \
them, ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and fuzzy are more accurate and \
RELIABLE_TECHNIQUES. in this paper basically, a LITERATURE_STUDY for \
SOLAR_RADIATION and ENERGY_PREDICTION using ann and \
FUZZY_LOGIC_TECHNIQUES has been carried out. many studies are reviewed \
and then selected some most accurate, reliable, and RELEVANT_STUDIES for \
further study. ANN_MODELS with DIFFERENT_ALGORITHMS such as feed forward \
back propagation based ann, multi layer feed forward based ANN_MODEL, \
LINEAR_REGRESSION with ANN_MODEL, gnn based model are reviewed in the \
study. ANN_MODELS with DIFFERENT_INPUT_PARAMETERS_COMBINATIONS and the \
DIFFERENT_NUMBER of neurons were also reviewed. FUZZY_LOGIC based and \
adaptive neuro fuzzy interface (anfis) based DIFFERENT_MODELS have been \
reviewed and observed that the ANFIS_TECHNIQUE_PERFORMS better. from the \
study, it has been noted that ann and FUZZY_LOGIC employed models are \
most effective for estimation than any other EMPIRICAL_MODELS. it is \
found that SOLAR_RADIATION and ENERGY_PREDICTION_MODELS are dependent on \
INPUT_PARAMETERS more. at last, highlighted some \

SHORT_CIRCUIT current, OPEN_CIRCUIT_VOLTAGE, MAXIMUM_POWER current, and \
MAXIMUM_POWER voltage are chosen as INPUT_PARAMETERS of \
SVM_BASED_FAULT_DIAGNOSIS_ALGORITHM. the DATA_PREPROCESSING methods are \
used to improve the quality of FAULT_DATA set considering the effects of \
the quality on the performance of SVM_BASED_FAULT_DIAGNOSIS_ALGORITHM. \
the GRID_SEARCH and K_FOLD_CROSS_VALIDATION methods are proposed to \
optimize the parameters of the SVM_BASED_FAULT_DIAGNOSIS_ALGORITHM. it \
gets TEST_ACCURACY of 97% by testing the trained \

inadequate to rely on HUMAN_RESOURCES to study all papers. very few \
studies have used MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS and \
VISUALIZATION_APPROACHES to analyze the trends and directions in \
WIND_POWER. to explore these, we collected 50,579 articles (20122019) \

from china NATIONAL_KNOWLEDGE_INFRASTRUCTURE (cnki). we \

visually DISPLAY_LITERATURE in the field of WIND_POWER via analysis of \
the trends with time sequence, hotspots in abstracts and keywords, and \
SPATIAL_DISTRIBUTION. china, the united states, and iran are the top \
three countries in the field of WIND_POWER. through analyzing the trends \
between 20122019, we find that RESEARCH_HOTSPOTS have changed. the \
USAGE_RATE of terms such as POWER_GENERATION_CONTROL, POWER_GRIDS, \
WIND_POWER plants, and wind turbines has significantly increased, and the \
CORRESPONDING_GROWTH_RATES are 10.91%, 7.06%, 6.28% and 4.33%, \
respectively. this study also provides information on the relationship of \
words of abstracts in papers, which shows that these words are mainly \
divided into four categories: forecasting, optimization, investment, \
energy and equipment. an implication of this study is that \

Abstract:
```
in this paper, an improvement of the \
PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM is proposed. the aim of this \
algorithm is to determine the optimal parameters of a \
ROBUST_FRACTIONAL_ORDER_CONTROLLER which guarantees \
STABILITY_AND_ROBUSTNESS of required nominal performances. CONTROLLERS \
with fractional order are first obtained by a PREVIOUS_TRANSFORMATION of \
the multi objective optimization problem into an equivalent single \
optimization problem, and then solved by the proposed improved \
PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM. in order to examine the \
STABILITY_AND_PERFORMANCE_ROBUSTNESS, this controller is applied on an \
ill conditioned WIND_TURBINE equipped with a doubly fed \
ASYNCHRONOUS_MACHINE, where the SYSTEM_DYNAMICS is modeled by an \
unstructured output multiplicative uncertainty model. the \
SIMULATION_RESULTS show the effectiveness of the proposed \
SYNTHESIS_METHOD, where the control is compared (for the same design \
frequency domain specifications) for both the \
ROBUST_FRACTIONAL_ORDER_CONTROLLER such as that designed through the \
STANDARD_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM and that obtained by \
resolving the multi objective optimization problem.  imeche 2012.

Abstract:

SUBSTANTIAL_PROGRESS in solar photovoltaic (spv) dissemination in grid \

MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT_TRACKING (mppt) is mounted in the middle of the power \
electronics converters and spv to achieve the MAXIMUM_OUTPUT with better \
precision from the SPV_SYSTEM under INTERMITTENT_WEATHER_CONDITIONS. as \
mppt is considered an ESSENTIAL_PART of the SPV_SYSTEM, up to now, many \
researchers have developed numerous mppt techniques, each with \
UNIQUE_FEATURES. a GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_SURVEY from 20152021 was performed to \
scrutinize the number of published review papers in this area. an online \
search established that on DIFFERENT_MPPT_TECHNIQUES, overall, 100 review \
articles were published; out of these 100, seven reviews on \
CONVENTIONAL_MPPT_TECHNIQUES under shading or partial shading and only \
four under non uniform solar irradiance are published. unfortunately, no \
dedicated review article has explicitly focused on soft computing mppt \
(sc mppt) techniques. therefore, a COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of articles on sc \
mppt techniques is desirable, in which almost all the familiar sc mppt \
techniques have to be summarized in one piece. this review article \
concentrates explicitly on soft computing based mppt techniques under non \
uniform irradiance conditions along with their operating principles, \
block/flow diagram. it will not only be helpful for academics and \
researchers to provide a FUTURE_DIRECTION in sc mppt optimization \
research, but also help the FIELD_ENGINEERS to select the appropriate sc \
mppt for spv according to SYSTEM_DESIGN and ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS. \

Title: combination of damage feature decisions with ADAPTIVE_BOOSTING for \
improving the DETECTION_PERFORMANCE of a STRUCTURAL_HEALTH_MONITORING \
framework: validation on an operating wind turbine
Abstract:
```
this article proposes the deployment of ADAPTIVE_BOOSTING (ADABOOST) for \
combining damage feature decisions and improving the DETECTION_ACCURACY \
of STRUCTURAL_HEALTH_MONITORING algorithms. in \
STRUCTURAL_HEALTH_MONITORING applications, DAMAGE_SENSITIVE_FEATURES are \
combined with classifiers to define DECISION_BOUNDARIES and provide \
information about the STRUCTURAL_STATE. BOOSTING algorithms combine \
MULTIPLE_CLASSIFIERS aiming at the improvement of their performance. in \
this study, ADABOOST is deployed on the realizations of a \
MODULAR_STRUCTURAL_HEALTH MONITORING framework, which consists of three \
tiers: DATA_NORMALIZATION based on environmental and \
OPERATIONAL_CONDITIONS; extraction of damage features, also referred to \
as CONDITION_PARAMETERS; and hypothesis testing. each \
CONDITION_PARAMETERHYPOTHESIS testing PAIR_COMPOSES a classifier which is \
used in ADABOOST as a WEAK_CLASSIFIER. the integration of ADABOOST with \
the STRUCTURAL_HEALTH_MONITORING framework is validated using \
EXPERIMENTAL_DATA of a 3 kw wind turbine located at the \
LOS_ALAMOS_NATIONAL_LABORATORY and data generated from a MECHANICAL_MODEL \
of the same structure. the ADABOOST_CLASSIFIER is evaluated with respect \
to the ERROR_RATE as well as the true positive and FALSE_POSITIVE_RATES, \
which are typically used in RECEIVER_OPERATING_CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES. the \
ADABOOST_CLASSIFIER_OUTPERFORMS the FRAMEWORK_CLASSIFIERS in many cases, \
improving drastically the DETECTION_PERFORMANCE. however, it is shown \
that the BOOSTING performance depends on the RELATIVE_LOCATION of the \
CONDITION_PARAMETER_VALUES on the CONDITION_PARAMETER_SPACE. the overlaps \
between the CONDITION_PARAMETER_VALUES to be combined are quantified \
using the BHATTACHARYYA_COEFFICIENT, which provides a metric for \
assessing the BOOSTING potential. finally, omitting \
CONDITION_PARAMETER_VALUES corresponding to SPECIFIC_ENVIRONMENTAL and \
OPERATIONAL_CONDITIONS from the BOOSTING process is proposed for \
obtaining optimum BOOSTING results.  the author(s) 2020.

continuously varying, which COMPLICATES_YIELD_PREDICTION. in \
RECENT_YEARS, machine learning (ml) techniques have entered the world of \
PV_POWER_FORECASTING to help increase the accuracy of predictions. \
researchers have seen great potential in this approach, creating a \
VAST_LITERATURE on the topic. this paper intends to identify the most \
POPULAR_APPROACHES and the gaps in this discipline. to do so, a \
REPRESENTATIVE_PART of the literature consisting of 100 publications is \
classified based on different aspects such as ML_FAMILY, location of \

Abstract:
```
currently, the SAVONIUS_WIND_TURBINE (swt) has established itself as a \
RELIABLE_WIND_TURBINE_SOLUTION, particularly for small scale wind farms. \
it is a RELIABLE_FORM of POWER_GENERATION owing to its self starting \
capability, lack of reliance on wind direction, and LOW_VIBRATION and \

MAIN_TECHNOLOGICAL_CHALLENGE in this field, however, is the \
INFERIOR_EFFICIENCY of SAVONIUS_TURBINES compared to their other \
counterparts. a LARGE_NUMBER of studies have been conducted to enhance \
the POWER_COEFFICIENT of swt. these studies primarily focused on \
BLADE_PROFILE and AUGMENTATION_STRATEGIES using simulation based \
OPTIMIZATION_APPROACHES. some RECENT_STUDIES, in contrast, have attempted \
to integrate ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) into the \

in this paper, a new differential particle swarm optimization (dpso) \
method is investigated for tracking the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT (mpp) for the \

mpp using few iterations, but also avoids the steady state oscillation \
phenomenon. moreover, the proposed method is capable for extracting the \
optimization power under varying TEMPERATURE_CONDITION as well as \
LARGE_FLUCTUATIONS of irradiation. to demonstrate the effectiveness of \
the proposed, the obtained results are compared to those obtained using \
the CONVENTIONAL_PERTURB and observation (p&o), INCREMENTAL_CONDUCTANCE \
(inccond), and CLASSICAL_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso). furthermore, \
a BOOST_CONVERTER supplied by a SOLAR_ARRAY_SIMULATOR is done to check \
the stability of the circuit. meanwhile, the dpso mppt algorithm is \
embedded in the PV_SYSTEM simulated by using SIMULINK_SOFTWARE and \

Abstract:
```
a HYBRID_NEURAL_NETWORK_APPROACH based tool for identifying the \
photovoltaic one diode model is presented. the \
GENERALIZATION_CAPABILITIES of NEURAL_NETWORKS are used together with the \
robustness of the reduced form of one diode model. indeed, from the \
studies performed by the authors and the works present in the literature, \
it was found that a DIRECT_COMPUTATION of the FIVE_PARAMETERS via \
MULTIPLE_INPUTS and MULTIPLE_OUTPUTS_NEURAL_NETWORK is a very \
DIFFICULT_TASK. the reduced form consists in a series of \
EXPLICIT_FORMULAE for the support to the NEURAL_NETWORK that, in our \
case, is aimed at predicting just two parameters among the five ones \
identifying the model: the other three parameters are computed by reduced \
form. the PRESENT_HYBRID_APPROACH is efficient from the \
COMPUTATIONAL_COST_POINT of view and accurate in the estimation of the \
FIVE_PARAMETERS. it constitutes a complete and extremely EASY_TOOL \

the parameters of the PHOTOVOLTAIC_CELLS and panels are very important to \

METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS from the ALGORITHM_FAMILIES is made for datasets \
from the specialized literature, using the following STATISTICAL_TESTS: \
ABSOLUTE_ERROR, root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR, and the coefficient of \
determination. the EQUIVALENT_CIRCUIT and MATHEMATICAL_MODEL considered \
is the single DIODE_MODEL. the RESULT_COMPARISON_SHOWS that the \
METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS have the best performance in almost all cases, \
and only for the GENETIC_ALGORITHM, there are POORER_RESULTS for one \
chosen PHOTOVOLTAIC_CELL. the parameters of the PHOTOVOLTAIC_CELLS and \
panels and also the current voltage characteristic for \
REAL_OUTDOOR_WEATHER_CONDITIONS are forecasted using the parameters \
calculated with the best method: one for analytical   the five parameter \
ANALYTICAL_METHOD   and one for the METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS   hybrid \
SUCCESSIVE_DISCRETIZATION_ALGORITHM. additionally, the GENETIC_ALGORITHM \
is used. the forecast current voltage characteristic is compared with the \
one measured in REAL_SUNLIGHT_CONDITIONS, and the best results are \
obtained in the case of a hybrid SUCCESSIVE_DISCRETIZATION_ALGORITHM. the \

Title: DIVIDE_AND_CONQUER q learning (dcql) ALGORITHM based photovoltaic (pv) \
ARRAY_RECONFIGURATION_SCHEME for alleviating the PARTIAL_SHADING \
influence
Abstract:
```
NONUNIFORM_IRRADIANCE on the photovoltaic (pv) ARRAY would cause \
MISMATCH_PROBLEM and decrease the generated POWER. to relieve the \
NEGATIVE_EFFECTS of PARTIAL_SHADING, reconfiguring the interconnection of \
the PV_ARRAY is a FAVORABLE_SOLUTION. however, the \
CURRENT_RECONFIGURATION_TECHNIQUES are usually limited by \
DIFFERENT_CORRESPONDING_FACTORS, e.g., not suit for \
VARIOUS_INSTANTANEOUS_SHADE_CASES, the shortage of EXPERTS_KNOWLEDGE or \
LARGE_AMOUNTS of data, EASY_COVERAGE to LOCAL_OPTIMA, and the \
STRICT_ASSUMPTIONS for application. therefore, in this paper a \
unsupervised ADAPTIVE_PV_ARRAY_RECONFIGURATION_TECHNIQUE is proposed with \
a DIVIDE_AND_CONQUER q learning (dcql) based ARRAY_RECONFIGURATION_SCHEME \
designed to decrease the influence of PARTIAL_SHADES. to testify the \
performance of the proposed PV_ARRAY_RECONFIGURATION_SCHEME, \
MATHEMATIC_THEORETICAL_EVALUATION and ELECTRIC_CHARACTERISTIC_ANALYSES \
are made and compared with those obtained by the conventional total cross \
tied (tct) arrangement, SUDOKU_CONNECTION, GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga) based \
scheme, as well as some lately proposed \
GRASSHOPPER_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM (goa), HARRIS_HAWKS_OPTIMIZER (hho), \
and LO_SHU (ls) technique based RECONFIGURATION_METHODS. besides, \
ADDITIONAL_ESTIMATION_INDICES, including MISMATCH_LOSS, fill factor, \
PERCENTAGE_POWER_LOSS and PERCENTAGE_POWER_ENHANCEMENT are calculated \
with SUBSTANTIAL_ANALYSES and comparisons. subsequently, the application \
of the proposed scheme in real time conditions is evaluated, with energy \
saving and INCOME_ANALYSIS estimated in comparison with other \
EMINENT_CHALLENGER_RECONFIGURATION_SCHEMES. at last, a \
COMPREHENSIVE_QUALITATIVE_COMPARISON_ASSESSMENT, with respect to \
DISPERSION_ABILITY under PARTIAL_SHADING conditions (psc), \
SENSOR_REQUIREMENT, wiring complexity and CAPITAL_INVESTMENT is carried \
out and proves the versatility of proposed methodology.  2022

Title: decarbonizing the grid by OPTIMAL_SCHEDULING of solar pv wind turbine \
PUMPED_HYDRO_STORAGE considering application on HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS: a \
COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
the potential for distributed generation (dg) to MINIMIZE_POWER_LOSS, \
INCREASE_PRODUCTIVITY, lower INVESTMENT_COSTS, and, most significantly, \
the ability to leverage RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES such as wind, \
photovoltaic (pv), and microturbines, which GENERATE_POWER with low \
greenhouse GAS_EMISSIONS, has piqued interest in the POWER_SECTOR. \
deploying dg in an UNFAVORABLE_LOCATION can result in a slew of problems, \
including increased SYSTEM_FAILURES and costs, VOLTAGE_SPIKES and swings, \
and stability and RESILIENCE_ISSUES. as a result, an OPTIMIZATION or \
perceptual technique based paradigm is needed to identify the \
OPTIMAL_CONFIGURATION of distributed RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION for a \
given system that can provide fiscal, environmental, and \
TECHNOLOGICAL_BENEFITS. several researchers looked at the best \
POSSIBLE_LOCATION for distributed RENEWABLE_GENERATION based on their \
needs and goals. the FORMAL_THEORY for this issue, however, remains \
unsolved. INDIVIDUAL_STUDIES on SOLAR_PV_SYSTEMS, types of \
SOLAR_PV_SYSTEMS, WIND_POWER generation, and PUMPED_HYDRO_STORAGE systems \
are all covered in detail in this paper. in addition, the STUDY_FOCUSES \
on a variety of OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES and algorithms for providing a \
better perspective on resolving issues related to the integration and \
functionality of many RENEWABLE_RESOURCES in an islanded as well as grid \
connected environment. the HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS are explained with \
RESPECTIVE_FLOW_CHARTS individually. finally, a COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS has \
been carried out in order to understand and validate the usefulness of \
INDIVIDUAL_OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES with itself and others.  2021 \

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES to predict ELECTRICITY_PRODUCTION from \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES
Abstract:
```
bearing in MIND_EUROPEAN_GREEN deal assumptions regarding a \
SIGNIFICANT_REDUCTION of GREEN_HOUSE_EMISSIONS, ELECTRICITY_GENERATION \
from RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (res) is more and more IMPORTANT_NOWADAYS. \
besides this, accurate and RELIABLE_ELECTRICITY_GENERATION_FORECASTS from \
res are needed for CAPACITY_PLANNING, scheduling, managing inertia and \
FREQUENCY_RESPONSE during CONTINGENCY_EVENTS. the recent three years have \
proved that MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) models are a PROMISING_SOLUTION for \
FORECASTING ELECTRICITY_GENERATION from res. in this review, the 8 step \
methodology was used to find and analyze 262 RELEVANT_RESEARCH_ARTICLES \
from the SCOPUS_DATABASE. STATISTIC_ANALYSIS based on eight criteria \
(ML_METHOD used, RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCE involved, AFFILIATION_LOCATION, \
HYBRID_MODEL proposed, SHORT_TERM_PREDICTION, AUTHOR_NAME, number of \
citations, and JOURNAL_TITLE) was shown. the results indicate that (1) \
EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE and ENSEMBLE_METHODS were the most \
POPULAR_METHODS used for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION FORECASTING from res in \
the last three years (20202022), (2) most of the research was carried out \
for wind systems, (3) the HYBRID_MODELS accounted for about a third of \
the analyzed works, (4) most of the articles concerned short term models, \
(5) the most researchers came from china, (6) and the journal which \
published the most papers in the analyzed field was energies. moreover, \
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the analyzed ml \

Title: PARAMETER_EXTRACTION of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_CELL and MODULE_MODELS with \
METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS: a review
Abstract:
```
as the photovoltaic (pv) MARKET_SHARE continues to increase, ACCURATE_PV \
modeling will have a MASSIVE_IMPACT on the FUTURE_ENERGY_LANDSCAPE. \
therefore, it is imperative to convert difficult to understand pv systems \
into UNDERSTANDABLE_MATHEMATICAL_MODELS through EQUIVALENT_PV_MODELS. \
however, the multi peaked, non linear, and strongly coupled \
characteristics of PV_MODELS make it challenging to extract \
ACCURATE_PARAMETERS of PV_MODELS. metaheuristics can address these \
challenges effectively regardless of gradients and FUNCTION_FORMS, and \
have gained increasing attention in solving this issue. this \
REVIEW_SURVEYS DIFFERENT_METAHEURISTICS to the \
PV_MODEL_PARAMETER_EXTRACTION and explains MULTIPLE_ALGORITHMS_BEHAVIOR. \
some frequently used PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS to measure the effectiveness, \
robustness, accuracy, competitiveness, and resources consumed are \
tabulated and compared, and then the merits and demerits of \
DIFFERENT_ALGORITHMS are outlined. the patterns of variation in the \
results extracted from DIFFERENT_EXTERNAL_ENVIRONMENTS were analyzed, and \
the CORRESPONDING_LITERATURE was summarized. then, challenges for both \
metaheuristics and APPLICATION_SCENARIOS are analyzed. finally, \

Title: study of meta heuristic OPTIMIZATION_METHODOLOGIES for DESIGN of hybrid \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
exponentially rising HYDROCARBON_FUEL_CONSUMPTION_CREATES several \
ENVIRONMENTAL_ISSUES that have necessitated the integration of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS (res) into the grid. SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC and WIND \
ENERGY_CONSTITUTES the most matured HYBRID_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEM (hres) \
ALTERNATIVE_TECHNOLOGY against CONVENTIONAL_FOSSIL fuels as it is \
pollution free, easily available, low price, and available in abundance. \
the INTERMITTENT_NATURE of SOLAR_IRRADIATION and fluctuation in WIND \
speed makes the SYSTEM_DESIGN inappropriate, making it either oversized \
or undersized. due to this, deploying solar pv WIND based hres is \
becoming either expensive or inefficient. thus, there is an \
IMMEDIATE_REQUIREMENT for OPTIMIZATION problem solving methodologies to \
minimize the HRES_COSTS. this paper mainly focuses on a \
CRITICAL_COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS of the many applied and \
PROMISING_OPTIMIZATION_METHODOLOGIES. the methodologies used to DESIGN \
the OPTIMAL_CAPACITY of hres, are categorized as traditional, modern, and \
hybrid on the basis of identified OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS, \
DECISION_VARIABLES, and EVALUATION_INDICATORS. while most of the \
PRESENT_STUDIES have been based on the TECHNICAL_RELIABILITY and \
ECONOMICAL_PERSPECTIVE of hres, in this paper the \
ENVIRONMENTAL_INDICATORS have got MAJOR_EMPHASIS. the facts emerging out \
of the study indicate that application of hybrid meta heuristic \
OPTIMIZATION techniques for ENGINEERING_APPLICATIONS is growing \
significantly due to their flexibility and efficiency. the application of \
ECONOMICAL_INDICATORS was observed to be more prevalent compared to other \
RELIABILITY and ENVIRONMENTAL_INDICATORS. however, the percentage of \
multi OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS of economical and RELIABILITY is a growing \
trend for the OPTIMAL_DESIGN_PROCESS of hres.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: a comprehensive review: study of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE optimization \
technique applications in a hybrid microgrid at times of fault outbreaks
Abstract:
```
the use of fossil fueled POWER_STATIONS to generate electricity has had a \
damaging effect over the years, necessitating the need for \
ALTERNATIVE_ENERGY_SOURCES. microgrids consisting of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCE_CONCEPTS have gained a lot of consideration in \
RECENT_YEARS as an alternative because they use advances in information \
and communication technology (ict) to increase the quality and efficiency \
of services and distributed energy resources (ders), which are \
environmentally friendly. nevertheless, microgrids are constrained by the \
outbreaks of faults, which have an impact on their performance and \
necessitate dynamic energy management and optimization strategies. the \
application of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) is gaining momentum as a \
VITAL_KEY at this point. this STUDY_FOCUSES on a comprehensive review of \
applications of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE strategies on hybrid \
RENEWABLE_MICROGRIDS for optimization, POWER_QUALITY_ENHANCEMENT, and \
analyses of fault outbreaks in microgrids. the use of techniques such as \
machine learning (ml), genetic algorithms (ga), artificial neural \
networks (ann), fuzzy logic (fl), particle swarm optimization (pso), \
heuristic optimization, ARTIFICIAL_BEE_COLONY (abc), and others is \
reviewed for VARIOUS_MICROGRID_STRATEGIES such as regression and \
classification in this study. applications of ai in microgrids are \
reviewed together with their benefits, drawbacks, and prospects for the \
future. the coordination and maximum penetration of RENEWABLE_ENERGY, \
SOLAR_PV, and wind in a hybrid microgrid under fault outbreaks are \
furthermore reviewed.  2023 by the authors.

the thin film ORGANIC_SOLAR_CELLS (oscs) are currently one of the most \
PROMISING_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGIES to effectively harvest the \
SOLAR_ENERGY due to their ATTRACTIVE_FEATURES of MECHANICAL_FLEXIBILITY, \
LIGHT_WEIGHT, low cost manufacturing, and solution processed large scale \
fabrication, etc. however, the RELATIVE_INSUFFICIENT LIGHT_ABSORPTION, \
SHORT_EXCITON_DIFFUSION_DISTANCE, and LOW_CARRIER_MOBILITY of the oscs \
determine the POWER_CONVERSION_EFFICIENCY (pce) of the devices are \
relatively lower than their INORGANIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC_COUNTERPARTS. to \
conquer the challenges, the two dimensional (2d) nanomaterials, which \
have EXCELLENT_PHOTOELECTRIC_PROPERTIES, TUNABLE_ENERGY_BAND_STRUCTURE, \
and SOLVENT_COMPATIBILITY etc., exhibit the GREAT_POTENTIAL to enhance \
the performance of the oscs. in this review, we summarize the most \
RECENT_SUCCESSFUL_APPLICATIONS of the 2D_MATERIALS, including graphene, \
BLACK_PHOSPHORUS, TRANSITION_METAL_DICHALCOGENIDES, and g c3 n4, etc., \
adapted in the CHARGE_TRANSPORTING_LAYER, the ACTIVE_LAYER, and the \
electrode of the oscs, respectively, for boosting the pce and stability \
of the devices. the strengths and weaknesses of the 2D_MATERIALS in the \
application of oscs are also reviewed in details. additionally, the \
challenges, COMMERCIALIZATION_POTENTIALS, and prospects for the further \
development of 2D_MATERIALS based oscs are outlined in the end.  2021 by \

Title: application of FUZZY_LOGIC in lift ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_CLASSIFICATION
Abstract:
```
the STUDY_OUTLINES a NEW_APPROACH to lift \
ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_CLASSIFICATION based on a HEURISTIC_ESTIMATOR using the \
ENERGY_PERFORMANCE_PARAMETERS of a lift installation registered over its \
WEEKLY_DUTY_CYCLE. due to the fact that evaluations of the \
ENERGY_PERFORMANCE by commonly applied methods involve a number of \
variables and COMPLEX_NONLINEAR_DEPENDENCIES, the EXPERT_MODEL is \
developed using the FUZZY_LOGIC_APPROACH. the underlying objectives are \
defined alongside the ENERGY_PERFORMANCE and OPERATING_PARAMETERS of a \
lift installation during the ride and in the STANDBY_MODE. the estimator \
is based on the OPERATIONAL_EQUIPMENT_EFFECTIVENESS for each mode of lift \
operation and MEMBERSHIP_FUNCTIONS (MODEL_INPUT and output) are defined. \
the method was verified by measurements taken on a REAL_OBJECT. this \
STUDY_SUMMARISES the MEASUREMENT_RESULTS and lift \
ENERGY_CLASSIFICATION_DATA obtained by the NEW_METHOD, the FINAL_RESULTS \
are presented in figures illustrating the ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_VARIATIONS in \
the running mode and as the AVERAGE_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_RATINGS on each day \
and over the WHOLE_WEEK.  2019, the author(s).

Title: COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of SOLAR_RADIATION modeling based on \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES: future concerns and \
considerations
Abstract:
```
an ALTERNATIVE_ENERGY_SOURCE such as solar is one of the most \
IMPORTANT_RENEWABLE_RESOURCES. a RELIABLE_SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION is \
essential for VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS in agriculture, industry, transport, \
and the environment because they reduce GREENHOUSE_GASES and are \
environmentally friendly. SOLAR_RADIATION_DATA_SERIES have embedded \
fluctuations and NOISE_SIGNALS due to complexity, stochasticity, non \
stationarity, and nonlinearity with uncertain and time varying nature. \
aside from being highly nonlinear, SOLAR_RADIATION is highly influenced \
by the environment and ENVIRONMENTAL_PARAMETERS such as AIR_TEMPERATURE, \
cloud cover, SURFACE_REFLECTIVITY, and aerosols. in addition, the \
SPATIAL_MEASUREMENTS of these variables are not readily available. to \
tackle these challenges, it is necessary to consider data \
PREPROCESSING_TECHNIQUES and to develop and TEST_PRECISE_SOLAR_RADIATION \
predicting models at different forecast horizons. there is, however, \
controversy regarding the performance of SUCH_MODELS in VARIOUS_STUDIES. \
comparisons are not conducted systematically among the DIFFERENT_STUDIES. \
using a CRITICAL_LITERATURE_REVIEW, the AUTHORS_HOPE to answer these \
questions and believe that further investigation of SOLAR_RADIATION can \
benefit researchers and practitioners alike. this study presents a \
COMPREHENSIVE_EVALUATION of SOLAR_RADIATION modeling using \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in the last 15 years and provides a novel \
detailed analysis of the AVAILABLE_MODELS. the studies conducted in \
DIFFERENT_CLIMATES of the world that were published in distinguished \
journals were considered (i.e., 90 papers in total) for this purpose. \
newly discovered procedures for optimizing forecasts, data cleaning, \
feature selection, CLASSIFICATION_METHODS, and stand alone or hybrid data \
driven models for SOLAR_RADIATION_PREDICTION and modeling were evaluated. \
the results strikingly showed that the most used \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_METHODS were ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK, adaptive \
neuro FUZZY_INFERENCE system, and DECISION_TREE_FAMILY of models. in \
addition, the EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE, SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE, and \
PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION were the most used OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES in \
SOLAR_RADIATION modeling. in terms of forecast horizons, the most common \
forecast horizon found in papers was on the DAILY_SCALE (51% of studies), \
followed by the hourly scale (26%), and the least common was the \
MONTHLY_SCALE (18%). based on the REGIONAL_STUDIES, the highest number of \
SOLAR_RADIATION_PAPERS originated from asia, with europe in second place \
and AFRICAN_COUNTRIES in third place. an increasing trend in the number \
of papers from 2011 to 2015 was noted, and the second peak started from \
2018 till the present. under each section, a summary of findings is \

Abstract:

SOLAR_IRRADIATION_DATA are imperatively required for any SOLAR_ENERGY \

greatly affect the implementation, management, and performance of \
photovoltaic or THERMAL_SYSTEMS. developing SOLAR_IRRADIATION_ESTIMATION \
and FORECASTING approaches is an EFFECTIVE_WAY to overcome these issues. \
practically, PREDICTION_APPROACHES can help ANTICIPATE_EVENTS by ensuring \
good operation of the POWER_NETWORK and maintaining a PRECISE_BALANCE \
between the demand and supply of the power at every moment. in the \

Title: statistical and MACHINE_LEARNING based DURABILITY TESTING_STRATEGIES for \
ENERGY_STORAGE
Abstract:
```
there is CONSIDERABLE_INTEREST in developing \
NEW_ENERGY_STORAGE_TECHNOLOGIES for the ELECTRIC_GRID, but \
ECONOMIC_VIABILITY will require that manufacturers provide warranties \
guaranteeing 15+ years of life. although there are EXTENSIVE_EFFORTS to \
make early predictions for the EXPECTED_LIFE of NEW_STORAGE_TECHNOLOGIES, \
we argue here that for the purposes of pricing warranties and valuing \
second life potentialconsiderations that are crucial to whether the \
technologies can be commercializedthe \
FULL_FAILURE_PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTION, not just the EXPECTED_LIFE, is \
required. we use published battery cycle life data to suggest efficient \
statistical and MACHINE_LEARNING based testing and ANALYSIS_STRATEGIES \
that can rapidly estimate and also take advantage of the \
FAILURE_PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTION. one approach is a WEIBULL_ANALYSIS, \
which can (1) reduce the number of testing MACHINE_HOURS required for \
setting a warranty, (2) quickly determine whether a NEW_TECHNOLOGY is \
better than a BASELINE_TECHNOLOGY, and (3) estimate the MAXIMUM_INTENSITY \
of testing ACCELERATION that does not change the FAILURE_MODE. a second \
approach is driven by the idea that all measured datasuch as capacity or \
energy as a function of time or CYCLE_NUMBERARE valuable and generated by \
an underlying LATENT_FUNCTION. this analysis employs a GAUSSIAN_PROCESS \
to find the underlying LATENT_FUNCTION, together with its uncertainties, \
which can be used to calculate the FAILURE_DISTRIBUTION.  2023 \

HOMOGENIZATION, the rmse and mbe of the monthly isccp itp data are \
reduced to 15.8 w/m2 and  1.6 w/m2, respectively, before 2000, which are \
comparable to those after 2000, making the accuracy of the NEW_DATASET \
stable throughout the WHOLE_PERIOD. moreover, the variations and trends \
of rs derived from the NEW_DATA are consistent with in situ observations \
at global and REGIONAL_SCALES. therefore, the HOMOGENIZATION can \

Title: FUZZY_LOGIC based DYNAMIC_PERFORMANCE_ENHANCEMENT of \
FIVE_PHASE_INDUCTION_MOTOR under arbitrary OPEN_PHASE_FAULT for \
ELECTRIC_VEHICLE
Abstract:
```
the MULTIPHASE_INDUCTION_MOTOR can be a highly PREFERABLE_CHOICE for the \
EV_APPLICATION, where the reliability and safety of passengers are one of \
the major concerns. the MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this article is to \
DESIGN_HIGH_PERFORMANCE_FAULT_TOLERANT_CONTROL of \
FIVE_PHASE_INDUCTION_MOTOR (fpim) drive to enhance the \
DYNAMIC_PERFORMANCE under healthy, faulty and FAULT_TOLERANT_MODES of \
operation under arbitrary OPEN_PHASE_FAULT_CONDITION. first, a \
SIMPLE_METHOD of modeling OPEN_PHASE_FAULT in any phase of the FPIM_DRIVE \
is proposed. the most frequently occurring OPEN_PHASE_FAULTS due to the \
POWER_ELECTRONICS_SWITCH_FAILURE in the inverters are considered for the \
analysis. a generalized method of modeling arbitrary OPEN_PHASE_FAULT in \
FPIM_DRIVE using back EMF_CALCULATIONS in FAULTY_PHASE is suggested. the \
developed METHOD_UTILIZES the same TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX for any \
OPEN_PHASE_FAULT such that the MINIMUM_MODIFICATION in CONTROL_STRATEGY \
is required under FAULT_CONDITION. thereafter, the CONTROL_TECHNIQUE is \
detailed. the ROTOR_FIELD_ORIENTED_CONTROL (rfoc) of fpim with \
FUZZY_LOGIC_SPEED_CONTROLLER is developed to \
GENERATE_OPTIMAL_TORQUE_REFERENCE. the design of flc is detailed with \
fine tuned scaling factor, RULE_BASE and MEMBERSHIP_FUNCTION to obtain \
ROBUST_PERFORMANCE of the drive under healthy and FAULT_TOLERANT_MODES of \
operation. the COMPLETE_RFOC_SCHEME for 2 HP_FPIM_DRIVE is built in \
matlab/simulink incorporating FUZZY_LOGIC_BASED_CONTROLLER to verify its \
performance. the comparison of transient and STEADY_STATE_RESPONSE and \
robustness (to the LOAD_DISTURBANCE as well as fault) obtained using \
developed FUZZY_LOGIC_BASED_CONTROLLER with those using \
CONVENTIONAL_PI_CONTROLLER is presented to prove the efficiency of the \
suggested controller under VARIOUS_SPEED_TORQUE_PROFILES. the \
effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy based FAULT_TOLERANT_CONTROLLER for \
FPIM_DRIVE is validated using op4510 controller based \
REAL_TIME_HIL_SIMULATOR.   2021 walter de GRUYTER_GMBH, berlin/boston \

Title: enhancing the efficiency of WIND_POWER using HYBRID_FIRE_FLY and \
GENETIC_ALGORITHM   ECONOMIC_LOAD_DISPATCH_MODEL
Abstract:
```
background: ECONOMIC_LOAD_DISPATCH (eld) is the process of applying \
NECESSARY_LOAD_DEMAND between generators in POWER_SYSTEM that satisfies \
all units, so as to decrease the cost of operation. in order to solve the \
ELD_PROBLEM, META_HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS are preferred. the combination of \
FIRE_FLY (ff) algorithm and GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga) is used in this \
research to solve the ELD_PROBLEM and optimize the WIND_ENERGY_OUTPUT. \
methods: the WIND_TURBINE_ROTATES by the force of the wind from nature. \
the OPTIMUM_VALUES of the INPUT_PARAMETERS of WIND_TURBINE such as cp, \
are predicted using GENETIC_ALGORITHM. thus, the WIND_TURBINE_OUTPUT is \
optimized. the output of the generator is optimized by the MPPT_METHODS \
in practice. the MPPT_METHOD deployed here is \
INCREMENTAL_CONDUCTANCE_METHOD. the WIND_ENERGY_OUTPUT is ac in nature. \
it is converted to dc using RECTIFIER_ACTION. then the BOOST_CONVERTER \
further boosts the OUTPUT_VALUE. the INVERTER_ACTION_CONVERTS the dc into \
ac and fed to grid. the fuel operating cost of the WIND_ENERGY_SYSTEM is \
reduced by means of the ffa thus solves the ELD_PROBLEM. the \
WIND_ENERGY_SYSTEM with optimized power to grid is implemented using \
MATLAB_SIMULINK_TOOL and eld is solved and executed by means of matlab \
coding. results: the INPUT_PARAMETERS of WIND_TURBINE such as cp and \
values are predicted by means of GENETIC_ALGORITHM, in order to obtain \
OPTIMAL_OUTPUT from the turbine. the POWER_COEFFICIENTS (cp) and tip \
speed  value of the WIND_TURBINE are found out, thus the \
WIND_TURBINE_OUTPUT is optimized. the GENERATOR_OUTPUT is optimized by \
MPPT_TECHNIQUE. conclusion: by adopting GENETIC_ALGORITHM the \
INPUT_PARAMETER_VALUE required for WIND_TURBINE is predicted. the \
ECONOMIC_LOAD_DISPATCH_PROBLEM is solved and COST_FUNCTION is minimized \
by deploying FIREFLY algorithm. the WIND_POWER_OUTPUT is optimized by \
hybrid ga ffa and the optimized power is fed to grid thus enhancing \
GRID_EFFICIENCY. the results obtained were tested using matlab/simulink \
platform. 2018 BENTHAM_SCIENCE_PUBLISHERS.

Title: a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SURFACE_DEFECT_DETECTION_METHOD for building based on \
DEEP_LEARNING
Abstract:
```
the INSPECTION_AND_DIAGNOSIS of BUILDING_ENGINEERING involve \
HEALTH_MONITORING of BUILDINGS and related facilities, and the \
utilization of RENEWABLE_ENERGY, such as SOLAR_ENERGY, is crucial for \
SMOOTH_OPERATION of MODERN_CONSTRUCTION_PROJECTS. the detection of \
SOLAR_PANEL_DEFECTS is related to the reliability and efficiency of \
building PHOTOVOLTAICS and has become a field of concern. using \
DEEP_LEARNING to DETECT_DEFECTS can improve the stability of building \
PHOTOVOLTAICS. however, achieving a balance between ALGORITHM_ACCURACY \
and REASONING_SPEED requires further study. this paper presents an \
improved algorithm based on yolo v5, named yolov5s gbc, which \
IMPROVES_ACCURACY and INFERENCE_SPEED. this demonstrates the advantages \
of fast and ACCURATE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_DEFECT_DETECTION. based on the \
classical yolo v5 algorithm, the ATTENTION_MECHANISM and bidirectional \
feature PYRAMID_NETWORK were adopted to improve the accuracy of \
DEFECT_DETECTION. then, the LIGHTWEIGHT_MODULE_GHOSTCONV and the \
GAUSSIAN_ERROR_LINEAR_UNIT_ACTIVATION_FUNCTION were used to reduce the \
number of MODEL_PARAMETERS and improve the REASONING_SPEED. further, the \
DEFECT_DATASET of ELECTROLUMINESCENCE_IMAGES proposed by the 35th \
european photovoltaic SOLAR_ENERGY conference and exhibition was used to \
verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. the EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS \
show that yolov5s gbc is superior to the ORIGINAL_METHOD in many \
EVALUATION_INDICES, i.e., the accuracy and INFERENCE_SPEED were increased \
by 2% and 20.3%, respectively. in conclusion, yolov5s gbc exhibited \
better performance compared to other DEEP_LEARNING_METHODS.  2023 \

Title: DEEP_LEARNING for forecasting based applications in \
CYBERPHYSICAL_MICROGRIDS: RECENT_ADVANCES and FUTURE_DIRECTIONS
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES can be deployed locally and efficiently using \
the concept of microgrids. due to the NATURAL_UNCERTAINTY of the \
OUTPUT_POWER of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES, the planning for a \
PROPER_OPERATION of microgrids can be a CHALLENGING_TASK. in addition, \
the information about the loads and the POWER_CONSUMPTION of them can \
create benefits to increase the efficiency of the microgrids. however, \
ELECTRICAL_LOADS can have uncertainty due to reasons such as \
UNPREDICTABLE_BEHAVIOR of the consumers. to exploit a microgrid, \
ENERGY_MANAGEMENT is required at the UPPER_LEVEL of operation and control \
in order to reduce the costs. one of the most IMPORTANT_TASKS of the \
ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM is to satisfy the loads and, in other words, \
develop a plan to maintain equilibrium between the POWER_GENERATION and \
POWER_CONSUMPTION. to obtain information about the OUTPUT_POWER of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES and POWER_CONSUMPTION, DEEP_LEARNING can be \
implemented as a POWERFUL_TOOL, which is able to predict the desired \
values. in addition, WEATHER_CONDITIONS can affect the OUTPUT_POWER of \
renewable energy based resources and the behavior of the consumers and, \
as a result, the POWER_CONSUMPTION. so, DEEP_LEARNING can be deployed for \
the anticipation of the WEATHER_CONDITIONS. this paper will study the \
RECENT_WORKS related to DEEP_LEARNING, which has been implemented for the \
prediction of the OUTPUT_POWER of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES (i.e., pvs \
and wind turbines), ELECTRICAL_LOADS, and WEATHER_CONDITIONS (i.e., \
SOLAR_IRRADIANCE and wind speed). in addition, for \
POSSIBLE_FUTURE_DIRECTIONS some strategies are suggested, the most \
important of which is the implementation of QUANTUM_COMPUTING in \
CYBERPHYSICAL_MICROGRIDS.  2023 by the authors.

Title: ROBUST_NONLINEAR_MPPT_CONTROLLER for PV_ENERGY_SYSTEMS using pso based \
INTEGRAL_BACKSTEPPING and ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_TECHNIQUES
Abstract:
```
a PV_SYSTEM is subject to RANDOM_VARIATIONS in ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS, \
and continuous tracking of the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT is an \
INDISPENSABLE_STEP to improve the PV_OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY. \
NUMEROUS_TECHNIQUES of MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT tracking have been reported in \
the literature. however, these TECHNIQUES_SUFFER from NUMEROUS_PROBLEMS \
such as oscillation around the MAXIMUM_POWER_POINT and do not provide \
SATISFACTORY_ROBUSTNESS. taking into account the NONLINEAR_NATURE of the \
PV_MODULE and POWER_ELECTRONICS_CONVERTERS in PV_SYSTEMS, \
NONLINEAR_CONTROL represents a VITAL_CONTROL_SOLUTION to guarantee both \
an optimal and ROBUST_PV_SYSTEM. the NONLINEAR_CONTROL_STRATEGY proposed \
in this WORK_FORMS a closed loop system between the PV_MODULE, boost \
converter, load, an ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL for \
REFERENCE_PREDICTION, and an INTEGRAL_BACKSTEPPING controller. the \
stability of the controller has been verified by LYAPUNOV_THEORY and the \
controller has been optimized using the PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso) \
method. NUMERICAL_SIMULATIONS with RIGOROUS_ROBUST_TESTS have proved the \
SUPERIOR_PERFORMANCE of the proposed controller as compared to perturb \
and observe, and pso terminal sliding MODE_CONTROLLER. the proposed \
controller was further verified under \

Abstract:
```
due to the growing demand, assessing performance has become obligatory \
for photovoltaic (pv) ENERGY_HARVESTING_SYSTEMS. \
PERFORMANCE_ASSESSMENT_INVOLVES estimating \

as ASSESSMENT_METHODS, are no longer reliable enough to provide a \
REASONABLE_PROJECTION of PV_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS. estimating \
SYSTEM_PARAMETERS using MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) approaches has become a \
reliable and POPULAR_METHOD because of its speed and accuracy. this paper \
systematically reviewed ml based PV_PARAMETER_ESTIMATION_STUDIES \
published in the last three years (2020  2022). studies were analyzed \
using several criteria, including ML_ALGORITHM, outcome, \
EXPERIMENTAL_SETUP, SAMPLE_DATA_SIZE, and ERROR_METRIC. the analysis \
revealed several INTERESTING_FACTORS. the NEURAL_NETWORK was the most \
POPULAR_ML_METHOD (32.55%), followed by RANDOM_VECTOR FUNCTIONAL_LINK \
(13.95%) and SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE (9.30%). dataset was sourced from \
HARDWARE_TESTS and computer based simulations: 66% of the studies used \
data from only COMPUTER_SIMULATION, 18% used data from only \
HARDWARE_SETUP, and the 16% experiments used data from both hardware and \
simulations to evaluate DIFFERENT_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS. the top three most \
commonly used ERROR_METRICS were root mean SQUARE_ERROR (29.1%), mean \
ABSOLUTE_ERROR (17.5%), and coefficient of determination (15.9%). our \
SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW will help RESEARCHERS_ASSESS_ML_ALGORITHMS' projection \

Abstract:
```
when using EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHMS to optimize WIND_FARM_LAYOUTS, it is \
computationally expensive to use COMPUTATIONAL_FLUID_DYNAMICS (cfd) model \
to evaluate DIFFERENT_WIND_FARM_LAYOUTS. to alleviate the difficulty, \
SURROGATE_MODELS are used to replace CFD_MODEL. SUCH_ALGORITHMS are \
called surrogate assisted EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHMS (saeas). in existing \
saeas, constructing a GLOBAL_SURROGATE for high dimensional problems is \
not reliable due to the curse of dimensionality. additionally, a \
LOCAL_SURROGATE_MODEL constructed with a fixed number of samples has \
limitations. to address these problems, an saea combining \
GLOBAL_EXPLORATION and LOCAL_EXPLOITATION is proposed. the \
GLOBAL_EXPLORATION is based on an adaptive surrogate assisted \
PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM, while the LOCAL_EXPLOITATION is \
based on a local rbf assisted SIMULATED_ANNEALING_ALGORITHM. in building \
a LOCAL_RBF_MODEL, according to the CURRENT_FUNCTION_EVALUATION, a \
CERTAIN_AMOUNT of OUTSTANDING_SAMPLES are selected from the data set. 10 \
BENCHMARK_FUNCTIONS with DIFFERENT_MODALITIES and dimensions have been \

Title: a state of the art review on the utilization of MACHINE_LEARNING in \
NANOFLUIDS, SOLAR_ENERGY_GENERATION, and the prognosis of SOLAR_POWER
Abstract:
```
in the contemporary DATA_DRIVEN era, the fields of MACHINE_LEARNING, \
DEEP_LEARNING, BIG_DATA, statistics, and DATA_SCIENCE are essential for \
FORECASTING outcomes and getting insights from data. this paper looks at \
how MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACHES can be used to \
ANTICIPATE_SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION, ASSESS_HEAT_EXCHANGER_HEAT transfer \
efficiency, and predict the thermo physical properties of NANOFLUIDS. the \
review specifically focuses on the POTENTIAL_USE of MACHINE_LEARNING in \
SOLAR_THERMAL_APPLICATIONS, PEROVSKITES, and PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER \
FORECASTING. predictions of NANOFLUID_CHARACTERISTICS and \
DEVICE_PERFORMANCE may be more accurately made with the development of \
MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS. the use of MACHINE_LEARNING in the creation \
of NEW_PEROVSKITES and the assessment of their effectiveness and \
stability is also included in the review. additionally, the \
PAPER_EXPLORES_DEVELOPMENTS in ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE, particularly \
DEEP_LEARNING, in this area and offers insights into techniques for \
FORECASTING SOLAR_POWER, including PV_PRODUCTION, CLOUD_MOTION, and \
WEATHER_CLASSIFICATION.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: a survey on advanced MACHINE_LEARNING and DEEP_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES \
assisting in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION
Abstract:
```
the sustainability of the earth depends on RENEWABLE_ENERGY. forecasting \
the output of RENEWABLE_ENERGY has a BIG_IMPACT on how we operate and \
manage our POWER_NETWORKS. accurate forecasting of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION is crucial to ensuring GRID_DEPENDABILITY and \
permanence and reducing the risk and cost of the ENERGY_MARKET and \
infrastructure. although there are several approaches to forecasting \
SOLAR_RADIATION on a GLOBAL_SCALE, the two most COMMON_ONES are \
MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS and CLOUD_PICTURES combined with \
PHYSICAL_MODELS. the objective is to present a summary of \
MACHINE_LEARNING based techniques for SOLAR_IRRADIATION forecasting in \
this context. RENEWABLE_ENERGY is being used more and more in the \
WORLDS_ENERGY_GRID. NUMEROUS_STRATEGIES, including hybrids, \
PHYSICAL_MODELS, STATISTICAL_APPROACHES, and \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNIQUES, have been developed to anticipate the \
use of RENEWABLE_ENERGY. this PAPER_EXAMINES_METHODS for forecasting \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY based on DEEP_LEARNING and MACHINE_LEARNING. review and \
analysis of DEEP_LEARNING and MACHINE_LEARNING_FORECASTS for \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY come first. the second paragraph describes \
METAHEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES for RENEWABLE_ENERGY. the third \
topic was the OPEN_ISSUE of projecting RENEWABLE_ENERGY. i will wrap up \
with a few potential FUTURE_JOB_OBJECTIVES.  2023, the author(s), under \

Title: role of ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS in predicting design and EFFICIENCY of \
DYE_SENSITIZED_SOLAR_CELLS
Abstract:
```
PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY_ATTRACTS_RESEARCHERS from industry and academia \
due to its potential in producing electricity directly from the sunlight. \
among all the PHOTOVOLTAIC_DEVICES, the DYE_SENSITIZED SOLAR_CELL has \
gained preference due to its LOW_COST_FABRICATION and versatility in \
ELECTROLYTES, dye, substrate, and catalyst. the optical, electrical, and \
STRUCTURAL_PROPERTIES of the materials determine the \
POWER_CONVERSION_EFFICIENCY of a SOLAR_CELL. but, conducting experiments \
in the laboratory to identify the SUITABLE_MATERIALS for the FABRICATION \
of an EFFICIENT_SOLAR_CELL requires much time, cost, and HUMAN_EFFORT. \
the proven potential of MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES in PATTERN_MATCHING \
and COMPUTER_VISION motivated the researchers to employ these techniques \
for predicting the EFFICIENCY of SOLAR_CELLS. the research works \
conducted so far show the applications of these techniques in predicting \
the OPTIMUM_EFFICIENCY, best SUITABLE_DESIGN, and material for the \
FABRICATION of DYE_SENSITIZED_SOLAR_CELLS (dsscs). in this paper, the \
authors present a COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of the MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES \
employed and the types of INPUT_DATA used for predicting the design and \
EFFICIENCY of SOLAR_CELLS. they also give ESSENTIAL_INSIGHTS into the \
selection of OPTIMUM_PARAMETERS for selecting the materials for \
fabricating a substrate, DYE_SENSITIZER, semiconductor, electrolyte, and \
catalyst for designing the most efficient DYE_SENSITIZED SOLAR_CELL \
without conducting experiments in the laboratory. this paper may prove a \
time and cost saving assistant for developing a customized \
NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL for predicting the EFFICIENCY of a DSSC from the \
dataset available in the literature. highlights: \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) model is useful to identify the \
SUITABLE_MATERIALS for EFFICIENT_DSSC_ASSEMBLY. the tailored \
NEURAL_NETWORK_MODELS_MINIMIZE the need for hit and TRIAL_EXPERIMENTS. \
the hybrid of ann and GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga) offers a low cost \
technological solution for DSSC_ASSEMBLY. the EXPERIMENTAL_DATA are vital \
for extracting USEFUL_INSIGHTS for DSSC_FABRICATION.  2022 JOHN_WILEY & \

Title: applications of METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS in \
SOLAR_AIR_HEATER_OPTIMIZATION: a review of RECENT_TRENDS and \
FUTURE_PROSPECTS
Abstract:
```
a transition to SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS is considered one of the most \
IMPORTANT_ALTERNATIVES to CONVENTIONAL_FOSSIL fuels. until recently, \
SOLAR_AIR_HEATERS (sahs) were among the other SOLAR_ENERGY_SYSTEMS that \
have been widely used in VARIOUS_HOUSEHOLDS and INDUSTRIAL_APPLICATIONS. \
however, the RECENT_LITERATURE_REVEALS that efficiencies of sahs are \
still low. some METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS have been used to enhance the \
efficiencies of these SAH_SYSTEMS. in the paper, we do not only discuss \
the techniques used to enhance the PERFORMANCE of sahs, but we also \
reviewed a majority of published papers on the applications of \
SAH_OPTIMIZATION. the METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS include \
SIMULATED_ANNEALING (sa), PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (pso), \
GENETIC_ALGORITHM (ga), ARTIFICIAL_BEE_COLONY (abc), teaching learning \
based optimization (tlbo), and elitist teaching learning based \
optimization (etlbo). for this research, it should be noted that this \
study is mostly based on the literature published in the last ten years \
in GOOD_ENERGY_TOP_JOURNALS. therefore, this paper clearly shows that the \
use of all six proposed METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS_RESULTS in \
SIGNIFICANT_EFFICIENCY_IMPROVEMENTS through the selection of the \
OPTIMAL_DESIGN set and operating parameters for sahs. based on the \
PAST_LITERATURE and on the outcomes of this paper, etlbo is \
unquestionably more competitive than abc, ga, pso, sa, and tlbo for the \
optimization of sahs for the same considered problem. finally, based on \
the covered six state of the art metaheuristic techniques, some \
perspectives and recommendations for the FUTURE_OUTLOOK of \
SAH_OPTIMIZATION are proposed. this paper is the first ever attempt to \
present the CURRENT_DEVELOPMENTS to a LARGE_AUDIENCE on the applications \
of METAHEURISTIC_METHODS in SAH_OPTIMIZATION. thus, researchers can use \
this paper for further research and for the advancement of the proposed \
and other recommended algorithms to generate the best PERFORMANCE for the \
VARIOUS_SAHS.   2021 jean de DIEU_NIYONTEZE et al.
