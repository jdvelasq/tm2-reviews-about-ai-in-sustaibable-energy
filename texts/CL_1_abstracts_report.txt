AB ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS are widely accepted as a TECHNOLOGY_OFFERING an
   ALTERNATIVE_WAY to tackle complex and ill defined problems.  they can learn
   from examples, are FAULT_TOLERANT in the sense that they are able to handle
   noisy and INCOMPLETE_DATA, are able to deal with non linear problems and,
   once trained, can perform prediction and generalisation at HIGH_SPEED. they
   have been used in DIVERSE_APPLICATIONS in control, robotics,
   PATTERN_RECOGNITION, forecasting, medicine, POWER_SYSTEMS, manufacturing,
   optimisation, SIGNAL_PROCESSING and social/psychological sciences.  they are
   particularly useful in system modelling such as in implementing
   COMPLEX_MAPPINGS and SYSTEM_IDENTIFICATION. this paper presents
   VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS of NEURAL_NETWORKS mainly in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PROBLEMS
   in a thematic rather than a chronological or any other order.
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS have been used by the author in the field of
   SOLAR_ENERGY; for modelling and design of a SOLAR_STEAM generating plant,
   for the estimation of a PARABOLIC_TROUGH_COLLECTOR_INTERCEPT_FACTOR and
   LOCAL_CONCENTRATION_RATIO and for the modelling and PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION
   of SOLAR_WATER heating systems.  they have also been used for the estimation
   of HEATING_LOADS of buildings, for the prediction of AIR_FLOW in a naturally
   ventilated TEST_ROOM and for the prediction of the ENERGY_CONSUMPTION of a
   PASSIVE_SOLAR_BUILDING. in all those models a multiple hidden
   LAYER_ARCHITECTURE has been used.  errors reported in these models are well
   within ACCEPTABLE_LIMITS, which clearly suggest that
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS can be used for modelling in other fields of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION and use.  the work of other researchers in the
   field of RENEWABLE_ENERGY and other ENERGY_SYSTEMS is also reported.  this
   includes the use of ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS in SOLAR_RADIATION and wind
   SPEED_PREDICTION, PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, BUILDING_SERVICES_SYSTEMS and load
   forecasting and prediction.  2001 ELSEVIER_SCIENCE_LTD.

AB ELECTRICAL_LOAD FORECASTING plays a VITAL_ROLE in order to achieve the
   concept of next GENERATION_POWER_SYSTEM such as SMART_GRID,
   EFFICIENT_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT and better POWER_SYSTEM_PLANNING. as a result,
   high forecast accuracy is required for MULTIPLE_TIME_HORIZONS that are
   associated with regulation, dispatching, scheduling and UNIT_COMMITMENT of
   POWER_GRID. artificial intelligence (ai) based techniques are being
   developed and deployed worldwide in on varity of applications, because of
   its SUPERIOR_CAPABILITY to handle the COMPLEX_INPUT and OUTPUT_RELATIONSHIP.
   this paper provides the comprehensive and SYSTEMATIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW of
   artificial intelligence based SHORT_TERM_LOAD FORECASTING techniques.  the
   MAJOR_OBJECTIVE of this study is to review, identify, evaluate and analyze
   the performance of artificial intelligence (ai) based load forecast models
   and RESEARCH_GAPS. the accuracy of ANN based forecast model is found to be
   dependent on number of parameters such as forecast MODEL_ARCHITECTURE,
   INPUT_COMBINATION, ACTIVATION_FUNCTIONS and training algorithm of the
   network and other EXOGENOUS_VARIABLES affecting on forecast MODEL_INPUTS.

TI REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING for DEMAND_RESPONSE: a review of algorithms and
   MODELING techniques
AU Vazquez-Canteli JR; Nagy Z
TC 381
SO Applied Energy
PY 2019
AB buildings account for about 40% of the GLOBAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION.
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES are one possibility to mitigate the dependence of
   RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS on the ELECTRICAL_GRID. however, their integration
   into the existing GRID_INFRASTRUCTURE must be done carefully to avoid
   instability, and guarantee availability and security of supply.
   DEMAND_RESPONSE, or demand side management, IMPROVES_GRID_STABILITY by
   increasing DEMAND_FLEXIBILITY, and SHIFTS_PEAK_DEMAND towards periods of
   peak RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION by providing consumers with
   ECONOMIC_INCENTIVES. this PAPER_REVIEWS the use of REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING, a
   MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHM, for DEMAND_RESPONSE_APPLICATIONS in the
   SMART_GRID. REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING has been utilized to control
   DIVERSE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS such as ELECTRIC_VEHICLES,
   HEATING_VENTILATION_AND_AIR_CONDITIONING (hvac) systems, SMART_APPLIANCES,
   or batteries.  the future of DEMAND_RESPONSE greatly depends on its ability
   to prevent CONSUMER_DISCOMFORT and integrate HUMAN_FEEDBACK into the
   CONTROL_LOOP. REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING is a potentially model free ALGORITHM
   that can adapt to its environment, as well as to HUMAN_PREFERENCES by
   directly integrating USER_FEEDBACK into its CONTROL_LOGIC. our REVIEW_SHOWS
   that, although many papers consider HUMAN_COMFORT and satisfaction, most of
   them focus on single agent systems with demand independent
   ELECTRICITY_PRICES and a STATIONARY_ENVIRONMENT. however, when
   ELECTRICITY_PRICES are modelled as demand dependent variables, there is a
   risk of shifting the PEAK_DEMAND rather than shaving it.  we identify a need
   to further EXPLORE_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to coordinate MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS
   that can participate in DEMAND_RESPONSE_PROGRAMS under demand dependent
   ELECTRICITY_PRICES. finally, we discuss directions for FUTURE_RESEARCH,
   e.g., quantifying how rl could adapt to changing URBAN_CONDITIONS such as
   BUILDING_REFURBISHMENT and urban or POPULATION_GROWTH.  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB under the background of CURRENT_ENVIRONMENTAL_POLLUTION and SERIOUS_SHORTAGE
   of FOSSIL_ENERGY, the development of ELECTRIC_VEHICLES driven by

   ELECTRIC_VEHICLE driven by FUEL_CELL is the most EFFECTIVE_SOLUTION. many
   scholars have found that the OUTPUT_PERFORMANCE of HYBRID_SYSTEM is an

AB ENORMOUS_AMOUNTS of data are being produced everyday by sub meters and
   SMART_SENSORS installed in RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS. if leveraged properly,
   that data could assist end users, ENERGY_PRODUCERS and UTILITY_COMPANIES in
   detecting ANOMALOUS_POWER_CONSUMPTION and understanding the causes of each
   anomaly.  therefore, ANOMALY_DETECTION could stop a MINOR_PROBLEM becoming
   overwhelming.  moreover, it will aid in better DECISION_MAKING to reduce
   wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy EFFICIENT_BEHAVIOR. in this
   regard, this paper is an in depth review of existing
   ANOMALY_DETECTION_FRAMEWORKS for BUILDING_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION based on
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE. specifically, an EXTENSIVE_SURVEY is presented, in
   which a COMPREHENSIVE_TAXONOMY is introduced to classify existing algorithms
   based on DIFFERENT_MODULES and parameters adopted, such as
   MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS, FEATURE_EXTRACTION approaches,
   ANOMALY_DETECTION levels, computing platforms and APPLICATION_SCENARIOS. to
   the best of the AUTHORS_KNOWLEDGE, this is the first REVIEW_ARTICLE that
   discusses ANOMALY_DETECTION in BUILDING_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION. moving forward,
   IMPORTANT_FINDINGS along with domain specific problems, difficulties and
   challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the
   absence of: (i) PRECISE_DEFINITIONS of ANOMALOUS_POWER_CONSUMPTION, (ii)
   annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of
   existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v)
   PRIVACY_PRESERVATION. following, insights about CURRENT_RESEARCH_TRENDS are
   discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the

AB consciousness of the need to decrease our UNNATURAL_WEATHER_CHANGES and of
   the CRITICAL_INCREASE in the costs of TRADITIONAL_SOURCES of energy have
   motivated many nations to provide INNOVATIVE_ENERGY_STRATEGIES that
   promulgate RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS. for example, solar, wind and hydro
   related energies are RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES, and they are environmentally
   friendly with the potential for BROAD_USE. all of the
   LOAD_REQUIREMENT_CONDITIONS in comparison with single usage can provide more
   economical and DEPENDABLE_ELECTRICITY, as well as environmentally
   FRIENDLY_SOURCES, by compounding SUCH_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES using
   BACKUP_UNITS to shape a HYBRID_SCHEME. sizing the HYBRID_SYSTEM_ELEMENTS
   optimally is one of the most IMPORTANT_MATTERS in this type of
   HYBRID_SYSTEM, which could sufficiently meet all of the LOAD_DEMANDS with a
   MINOR_FINANCIAL_INVESTMENT. although a number of studies have been performed
   on the OPTIMIZATION and sizing of hybrid RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS, this
   study presents a FULL_ANALYSIS of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_OPTIMUM_PLANS in

AB data analytics are now playing a more important role in the modern
   industrial systems.  driven by the development of information and
   communication technology, an information layer is now added to the
   conventional electricity transmission and distribution network for data
   collection, storage and analysis with the help of WIDE_INSTALLATION of
   SMART_METERS and sensors.  this paper introduces the big data analytics and
   corresponding applications in smart grids.  the characterizations of big
   data, smart grids as well as huge amount of data collection are firstly
   discussed as a prelude to illustrating the motivation and potential
   advantages of implementing advanced data analytics in smart grids.  basic
   concepts and the procedures of the TYPICAL_DATA_ANALYTICS for general
   problems are also discussed.  the advanced applications of different data
   analytics in smart grids are addressed as the main part of this paper.  by
   dealing with huge amount of data from electricity network, meteorological
   information system, geographical information system etc., many benefits can
   be brought to the existing power system and improve the customer service as
   well as the SOCIAL_WELFARE in the era of big data.  however, to advance the
   applications of the big data analytics in real smart grids, many issues such
   as techniques, awareness, synergies, etc., have to be overcome.  2018, the

PY 2021
AB microgrids have recently emerged as a building block for SMART_GRIDS
   combining distributed RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (ress),
   ENERGY_STORAGE_DEVICES, and LOAD_MANAGEMENT_METHODOLOGIES. the
   INTERMITTENT_NATURE of ress brings several challenges to the
   SMART_MICROGRIDS, such as reliability, POWER_QUALITY, and balance between
   supply and demand.  thus, FORECASTING POWER_GENERATION from ress, such as
   WIND_TURBINES and SOLAR_PANELS, is becoming essential for the efficient and
   PERPETUAL_OPERATIONS of the POWER_GRID and it also helps in attaining
   OPTIMAL_UTILIZATION of ress.  ENERGY_DEMAND FORECASTING is also an
   INTEGRAL_PART of SMART_MICROGRIDS that helps in planning the
   POWER_GENERATION and energy trading with COMMERCIAL_GRID. MACHINE_LEARNING
   (ml) and DEEP_LEARNING (dl) based models are PROMISING_SOLUTIONS for
   predicting CONSUMERS_DEMANDS and ENERGY_GENERATIONS from ress.  in this
   context, this manuscript provides a COMPREHENSIVE_SURVEY of the existing dl
   based approaches, which are developed for power FORECASTING of WIND_TURBINES
   and SOLAR_PANELS as well as ELECTRIC_POWER_LOAD FORECASTING. it also
   discusses the datasets used to train and test the different dl based
   PREDICTION_MODELS, enabling FUTURE_RESEARCHERS to identify
   APPROPRIATE_DATASETS to use in their work.  even though there are a few
   related SURVEYS regarding ENERGY_MANAGEMENT in SMART_GRID_APPLICATIONS, they
   are focused on a SPECIFIC_PRODUCTION_APPLICATION such as either solar or
   wind.  moreover, none of the SURVEYS_REVIEW the FORECASTING schemes for
   production and LOAD_SIDE simultaneously.  finally, PREVIOUS_SURVEYS do not
   consider the datasets used for FORECASTING despite their significance in dl
   based FORECASTING approaches.  hence, our SURVEY_WORK is intrinsically
   different due to its data centered view, along with presenting dl based
   applications for load and ENERGY_GENERATION FORECASTING in both residential
   and COMMERCIAL_SECTORS. the comparison of DIFFERENT_DL_APPROACHES discussed
   in this MANUSCRIPT_REVEALS that the efficiency of such FORECASTING methods
   is highly dependent on the amount of the HISTORICAL_DATA and thus a
   LARGE_NUMBER of DATA_STORAGE_DEVICES and HIGH_PROCESSING_POWER_DEVICES are
   required to deal with BIG_DATA. finally, this STUDY_RAISES several
   OPEN_RESEARCH_PROBLEMS and opportunities in the area of RENEWABLE_ENERGY

AB this paper proposes a novel demand responsemethod that aims at reducing the
   long term cost of CHARGING the battery of an individual plug in electric
   vehicle (pev). the problem is cast as a daily decision making problem for
   choosing the amount of energy to be charged in the pev battery within a day.
   we model the problem as a markov decision process (mdp) with unknown
   transition probabilities.abatch reinforcement learning (rl) algorithm is
   proposed for learning an optimum cost reducing CHARGING policy froma batch
   of TRANSITION_SAMPLES andmaking cost reducing CHARGING decisions in new
   situations.  in order to capture the dayto day differences of electricity
   CHARGING costs, the method makes use of ACTUAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICES for the
   current day and predicted electricity prices for the following day.  a
   BAYESIAN_NEURAL_NETWORK is employed for predicting the electricity prices.
   for constructing the RL_TRAINING_DATASET, we use historical prices.  a
   linearprogramming based method is developed for creating a dataset of
   optimal CHARGING decisions.  different CHARGING scenarios are simulated for
   each day of the historical time frame using the set of past electricity
   prices.  SIMULATION_RESULTS using real world pricing data demonstrate cost
   savings of 10% 50% for the pev owner when using the proposed CHARGING
   method.  2016 ieee.

AB in developed countries, BUILDINGS are involved in almost 50% of
   TOTAL_ENERGY_USE and 30% of global green house GAS_EMISSIONS. BUILDINGS'
   OPERATIONAL_ENERGY is highly dependent on VARIOUS_BUILDING physical,
   operational, and FUNCTIONAL_CHARACTERISTICS, as well as meteorological and
   TEMPORAL_PROPERTIES. besides physics based BUILDING_ENERGY modeling,
   MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES can provide faster and higher
   ACCURACY_ESTIMATES, given BUILDINGS' HISTORIC_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_DATA.
   looking beyond INDIVIDUAL_BUILDING_LEVELS, FORECASTING
   BUILDINGS_ENERGY_PERFORMANCE helps city and COMMUNITY_MANAGERS have a better
   understanding of their FUTURE_ENERGY_NEEDS, and plan for satisfying them
   more efficiently.  focusing on an URBAN_SCALE, this study systematically
   reviews 70 JOURNAL_ARTICLES, published in the field of
   BUILDING_ENERGY_PERFORMANCE_FORECASTING between 2015 and 2018. the
   RECENT_LITERATURE have been categorized according to five criteria: 1.
   learning method, 2. building type, 3. energy type, 4. input data, and 5.
   time scale.  the scarcity of BUILDING_ENERGY_PERFORMANCE_FORECASTING studies
   in URBAN_SCALE versus INDIVIDUAL_LEVEL is considerable.  there is no study
   incorporating BUILDING_FUNCTIONALITY in terms of

   therefore, it is significant and urgent to develop

   of energy efficient and green buildings.  however, it is a NONTRIVIAL_TASK
   due to the following challenges.  first, it is generally difficult to
   develop an explicit building thermal dynamics model that is both accurate
   and efficient enough for building control.  second, there are many
   UNCERTAIN_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS (e.g., RENEWABLE_GENERATION_OUTPUT,
   OUTDOOR_TEMPERATURE, and the number of occupants). third, there are many
   spatially and temporally coupled OPERATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS. fourth,
   BUILDING_ENERGY_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEMS can not be solved in REAL_TIME by
   TRADITIONAL_METHODS when they have extremely LARGE_SOLUTION_SPACES. fifthly,

AB low power and lossy networks (llns) have recently emerged as a promising and
   ATTRACTIVE_PARADIGM. the ipv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy
   networks (RPL), proposed by the ietf roll working group, is specifically
   designed for lln and is compliant with the 6lowpan protocol.  RPL has gained
   a SIGNIFICANT_MATURITY, and is still attracting more researchers
   contributing to its improvement.  RPL_BUILDS a destination oriented
   DIRECTED_ACYCLIC_GRAPH (dodag) based on a set of metrics and constraints
   through SPECIFIC_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS (ofs). the ofs select the best parent
   of nodes to build and optimize the route.  however, the
   STANDARD_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS have some limitations due to the use of a
   single metric.  in this paper, we propose a new of based on combined metrics
   using fuzzy logic (of ec). to overcome the limitations of the use of a
   single metric, the proposed of ec considers both the link and the node
   metrics, namely the expected transmission count (etx), hop count (hc) and
   the energy consumption (ec). the SIMULATION_RESULTS demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the new of ec in comparison with the mrhof, entot, and of
   fuzzy in improving RPL_PERFORMANCES in terms of pdr, network lifetime,
   CONVERGENCE_TIME, latency, overhead, and energy consumption.  our results
   show that of ec keeps the RPL_OVERALL_EFFICIENCY independent from the
   network topology and the TRANSMISSION_RANGE. moreover, the proposed of ec
   outperforms the other proposals in balancing the energy consumption of all
   nodes in the network.  2018 elsevier ltd

AB it is of great significance to achieve the prediction of building energy
   consumption.  however, machine learning, as a promising technique for many
   practical applications, was rarely utilized in this field.  the most
   important reason is that the predictive structure with best performance is
   difficult to be determined.  to fill the gap, this paper offers one in depth
   review, which focuses on the ACCURACY_ANALYSES and model comparisons.
   specifically, the ACCURACY_ANALYSES were conducted based on different types
   of buildings (e.g.  residential building, commercial building, government
   building or educational building), different type of TEMPORAL_GRANULARITY
   (e.g.  sub hourly, hourly, daily or annual), as well as input/output
   variables and historical data collections.  further,
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and support vector machine (svm), as the
   epidemic models, were compared in terms of their complexity of prediction
   processes, accuracies of results, the amounts of required historical data,
   the numbers of inputs, etc.  then the hybrid and single machine learning
   methods were outlined and compared in terms of their strengths and
   weaknesses.  in addition, several VITAL_DEFECTS and further research
   directions are presented from a multivariate perspective.  we hope that
   machine learning method could capture more attention from investigators via
   our introduction and perspective, due to its potential development of

AB this RESEARCH_INVESTIGATES ELECTRIC_VEHICLE (ev) charging behavior and aims
   to find the best method for its prediction in order to optimize the ev
   charging schedule.  this PAPER_DISCUSSES several commonly used
   MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS to predict charging behavior, including stay
   duration and ENERGY_CONSUMPTION based on historical charging records.  it is
   noted that PREDICTION_ERROR_INCREASES along with the rise of DATA_ENTROPY or
   the decrease of DATA_SPARSITY. thus, this PAPER_ACCOUNTS for both indicators
   by defining the ENTROPY/sparsity ratio (r). when r is low,
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_REGRESSION (svr) and RANDOM_FOREST (rf) REGRESSION_SHOW
   better accuracy for stay duration and ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_PREDICTIONS,
   respectively.  while r is high, a diffusion based KERNEL_DENSITY_ESTIMATOR
   (dkde) performs better for both predictions.  the three methods are
   assembled as the proposed ensemble predicting ALGORITHM (epa) to improve
   predicting performance by decreasing 11% of the duration and 22% of the
   ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_PREDICTION_ERRORS. the PREDICTION_RESULTS are then
   applied to an OPTIMAL_EV charging SCHEDULING_ALGORITHM to
   MINIMIZE_LOAD_VARIANCE while reducing the ev charging cost.  a
   NUMERICAL_SIMULATION using real charging data is conducted to show the
   effectiveness of improved predictions and EV_LOAD_MANAGEMENT. the results
   show that the charging scheduling combined with EPA_PREDICTION can reduce
   27% of PEAK_LOAD, 10% of LOAD_VARIATION, and 4% COST_REDUCTION, compared to
   uncoordinated charging.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB the CURRENT_TREND indicates that ENERGY_DEMAND and supply will eventually be
   controlled by AUTONOMOUS_SOFTWARE that optimizes DECISION_MAKING and
   ENERGY_DISTRIBUTION_OPERATIONS. new state of the art MACHINE_LEARNING (ml)
   technologies are integral in optimizing DECISION_MAKING in
   ENERGY_DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS and systems.  this study was conducted on
   DATA_DRIVEN probabilistic ml techniques and their real time applications to
   SMART_ENERGY_SYSTEMS and networks to highlight the urgency of this area of
   research.  this study focused on two KEY_AREAS: i) the use of ml in
   CORE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES and ii) the USE_CASES of ml for
   ENERGY_DISTRIBUTION_UTILITIES. the CORE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES include the use
   of ml in advanced ENERGY_MATERIALS, ENERGY_SYSTEMS and STORAGE_DEVICES,
   ENERGY_EFFICIENCY, SMART_ENERGY_MATERIAL manufacturing in the
   SMART_GRID_PARADIGM, STRATEGIC_ENERGY_PLANNING, integration of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY, and BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS in the SMART_GRID_ENVIRONMENT. the
   investigated ML_AREA in ENERGY_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEMS includes
   ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and price forecasting, the MERIT_ORDER of ENERGY_PRICE
   forecasting, and the CONSUMER_LIFETIME_VALUE. CYBERSECURITY_TOPICS for
   POWER_DELIVERY and utilization, GRID_EDGE_SYSTEMS and distributed
   ENERGY_RESOURCES, POWER_TRANSMISSION, and DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEMS are also
   briefly studied.  the PRIMARY_GOAL of this work was to identify
   COMMON_ISSUES useful in FUTURE_STUDIES on ml for
   SMOOTH_ENERGY_DISTRIBUTION_OPERATIONS. this study was concluded with many
   ENERGY_PERSPECTIVES on SIGNIFICANT_OPPORTUNITIES and challenges.  it is
   noted that if the SMART_ML_AUTOMATION is used in its targeting
   ENERGY_SYSTEMS, the UTILITY_SECTOR and ENERGY_INDUSTRY could potentially

AB with the increasing integration of distributed ENERGY_RESOURCES (der) in the

   UNIT_COMMITMENT (uc) are the two MAJOR_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_PROBLEMS that
   play CRITICAL_ROLE in the safe and STABLE_OPERATION of a GRID_SYSTEM. the
   uncertainty associated with RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES have made the
   RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_PROBLEMS even more challenging for GRID_OPERATORS. the
   FUTURE_GRID will have a higher GENERATION_MIX of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES
   and a LARGE_LOAD of ELECTRICAL_VEHICLES, with the possibility of bi

AB a number of DECARBONIZATION_SCENARIOS for the ENERGY_SECTOR are built on
   SIMULTANEOUS_ELECTRIFICATION of ENERGY_DEMAND, and DECARBONIZATION of
   ELECTRICITY_GENERATION through RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. however, increased
   ELECTRICITY_DEMAND due to heat and TRANSPORT_ELECTRIFICATION and the
   variability associated with renewables have the potential to disrupt
   STABLE_ELECTRIC_GRID_OPERATION. to address these issues using
   DEMAND_RESPONSE, researchers and practitioners have increasingly turned
   towards automated DECISION_SUPPORT_TOOLS which UTILIZE_MACHINE_LEARNING and
   OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS. however, when applied naively, these
   ALGORITHMS_SUFFER from HIGH_SAMPLE_COMPLEXITY, which means that it is often
   impractical to fit sufficiently COMPLEX_MODELS because of a lack of observed
   data.  RECENT_ADVANCES have shown that techniques such as TRANSFER_LEARNING
   can address this problem and improve their PERFORMANCE considerably  both in
   supervised and REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_CONTEXTS. SUCH_FORMULATIONS allow
   models to leverage existing DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE and HUMAN_EXPERTISE in addition
   to SPARSE_OBSERVATIONAL_DATA. more formally, TRANSFER_LEARNING embodies all
   techniques where one aims to increase (learning) PERFORMANCE in a
   TARGET_DOMAIN or task, by using knowledge gained in a SOURCE_DOMAIN or task.
   this paper provides a detailed overview of state of the art techniques on
   applying TRANSFER_LEARNING in DEMAND_RESPONSE, showing improvements that can
   exceed 30% in a variety of tasks.  we observe that most research to date has
   focused on TRANSFER_LEARNING in the context of
   ELECTRICITY_DEMAND_PREDICTION, although REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based
   controllers have also seen increasing attention.  however, a number of
   limitations remain in these studies, including a lack of benchmarks,

AB the SMART_POWER_GRID_BLENDS the BIDIRECTIONAL_ENERGY with INFORMATION_FLOW.
   compared to the TRADITIONAL_POWER_GRID, it requires more intelligent and
   faster control, protection, automation, and COMMUNICATION_TECHNIQUES.
   ultimately, POWER_SYSTEM_PROTECTION, FAULT_LOCATION, and isolation have to
   go through an IMMENSE_MODERNIZATION_PROCESS since the previously used
   PROTECTION_TECHNIQUES are no longer usable in the SMART_GRID. this is due to
   the BIDIRECTIONAL_FLOW of energy and dynamics of the NETWORK_CONFIGURATION
   in the SMART_GRID. MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS (mas) techniques can enable the
   POWER_SYSTEM to become smarter, reliable, SELF_HEALING, and robust.  its
   decentralized nature and OPERATIONAL_ROBUSTNESS make the MAS_APPLICATION a
   leading technology.  in this paper, the MAS_ARCHITECTURE that suits the
   SMART_GRID_APPLICATION is proposed.  besides, a detailed SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW
   on the application of mas to SMART_GRID_PROTECTION is conducted.  the
   MAS_APPLICATION for SELF_HEALING of the SMART_GRID through FAULT_LOCATION,
   isolation, and SERVICE_RESTORATION (FLISR) is also investigated.
   furthermore, based on the MAS_ARCHITECTURE, FAULT_IDENTIFICATION_TECHNIQUE,
   simulation, and VERIFICATION_METHODS implemented, a comparison is made among
   the ongoing RESEARCH_ACTIVITIES on POWER_SYSTEM_PROTECTION and FLISR.
   consequently, the RESEARCH_GAP on POWER_SYSTEM_PROTECTION, FLISR, and
   SELF_HEALING is indicated.  finally, the use of IEC_61850 for implementing

   communication among the agents and outside LABORATORY_APPLICATION of the mas
   for the POWER_SYSTEMS are the RESEARCH_TOPICS that require further work.

   produced in ANAEROBIC_DIGESTERS could be directly used as fuel, thereby
   reducing the release of BIOGAS to the atmosphere.  due to the limited
   knowledge on the DIFFERENT_PROCESS_DISTURBANCES and MICROBIAL_COMPOSITION

   CONTROL_STRATEGIES with respect to EXTERNAL_INFLUENCES are needed without
   wasting time and resources.  different simple and COMPLEX_MECHANISTIC and

   processes taking place in the ad system.  MICROBIAL_ACTIVITIES have been
   incorporated in some of these models to serve as a PREDICTIVE_TOOL in

PY 2022
AB the BUILT_ENVIRONMENT sector is responsible for almost one third of the
   world's FINAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION. hence, seeking PLAUSIBLE_SOLUTIONS to
   MINIMISE_BUILDING_ENERGY_DEMANDS and mitigate ADVERSE_ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS
   is necessary.  ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) techniques such as machine and
   DEEP_LEARNING have been increasingly and successfully applied to develop
   solutions for the BUILT_ENVIRONMENT. this review provided a CRITICAL_SUMMARY
   of the existing literature on the machine and DEEP_LEARNING_METHODS for the
   BUILT_ENVIRONMENT over the PAST_DECADE, with SPECIAL_REFERENCE to holistic
   approaches.  different ai based techniques employed to resolve
   interconnected problems related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning
   (hvac) systems and ENHANCE_BUILDING_PERFORMANCES were reviewed, including
   energy forecasting and management, indoor AIR_QUALITY and occupancy
   comfort/satisfaction prediction, OCCUPANCY_DETECTION and recognition, and
   FAULT_DETECTION and diagnosis.  the PRESENT_STUDY explored existing ai based
   techniques focusing on the framework, methodology, and performance.  the
   literature highlighted that selecting the most SUITABLE_MACHINE_LEARNING and
   DEEP_LEARNING_MODEL for solving a problem could be challenging.  the
   RECENT_EXPLOSIVE_GROWTH experienced by the RESEARCH_AREA has led to hundreds
   of MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS being applied to building performance related
   studies.  the literature showed that existing RESEARCH_STUDIES considered a
   WIDE_RANGE of scope/scales (from an hvac component to URBAN_AREAS) and
   TIME_SCALES (minute to year). this makes it difficult to find an
   OPTIMAL_ALGORITHM for a SPECIFIC_TASK or case.  the studies also employed a
   WIDE_RANGE of EVALUATION_METRICS, adding to the challenge.  further
   developments and more SPECIFIC_GUIDELINES are required for the
   BUILT_ENVIRONMENT field to encourage best practices in evaluating and
   selecting models.  the literature also showed that while machine and
   DEEP_LEARNING had been successfully applied in BUILDING_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY
   research, most of the studies are still at the experimental or testing
   stage, and there are limited studies which implemented machine and
   DEEP_LEARNING_STRATEGIES in ACTUAL_BUILDINGS and conducted the post
   occupancy evaluation.  2022

   although several THEORETICAL_DEFINITIONS of the term 'agent' exist, there is
   a lack of PRACTICAL_UNDERSTANDING that might be improved by clearly
   distinguishing the AGENT_TECHNOLOGIES from other state of the art control
   technologies.  in this paper we clarify the differences between controllers,

   RECENT_SMART_GRID_PROJECTS, and contrast their interpretations with our
   understanding of agents and MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS. we point out that
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS applied in the SMART_GRID can add value when they are
   understood as fully distributed networks of CONTROL_ENTITIES embedded in
   DYNAMIC_GRID_ENVIRONMENTS; able to operate in a COOPERATIVE_MANNER and to

AB a SMART_CITY (sc) is a modernized URBAN_COMMUNITY, which
   INCORPORATES_INFORMATION and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGY (ict) into the

   services such as intelligent transport and ENERGY_CONSERVATION to its
   residents.  among the VARIOUS_SERVICES offered, a continuous and widespread
   supply of ELECTRICITY_DRAWS the MAXIMUM_ATTENTION. moreover, a
   SUBSTANTIAL_AMOUNT of this electricity is utilized by heating and COOLING
   loads, making them SIGNIFICANT_CONTRIBUTORS of GLOBAL_WARMING. keeping focus
   on these points, a sc is modeled in this paper,
   WHEREIN_ELECTRICITY_CONSUMPTION is minimized by modifying the traditional
   heating and COOLING system.  the proposed system collects SOLAR_HEAT and
   recovers INDUSTRIAL_WASTE_HEAT to deliver heating and COOLING services to
   the SC_RESIDENTS. for the purpose of storing the HEAT_ENERGY, a
   SEASONAL_THERMAL_ENERGY_STORAGE (stes) system has been proposed.  the
   proposed STES_SYSTEM_SUPPLIES stored THERMAL_ENERGY to heat driven COOLING
   and heating equipments.  moreover, CENTRAL_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM (cems)
   is also modeled for monitoring, regulating and controlling the flow of
   THERMAL_ENERGY. the designed cems consists of a FUZZY_ROUGH_SET controller
   for SCHEDULING_HEAT to cater the INSTANTANEOUS_THERMAL_ENERGY_REQUIREMENTS.
   FUZZY_ROUGH_SET has been used because it eliminates the issues of vagueness,
   uncertainty, and ensures efficient real time computations.  RESULTS_DEPICT
   that the HEAT_ENERGY obtained from SOLAR_THERMAL_COLLECTORS and

   systems.  many studies related to the ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM in
   SMART_BUILDINGS have been conducted.  however, the THERMAL_COMFORT of
   occupants at lower ENERGY_CONSUMPTION is a SIGNIFICANT_CHALLENGE to
   researchers.  therefore, in this study, a NEW_SMART_APPROACH is presented,
   which has the ability to take into account the impact of the next
   WALL_NEIGHBORS, and the OUTSIDE_TEMPERATURE to reduce the ENERGY_CONSUMPTION
   of an HVAC_SYSTEM without affecting the THERMAL_COMFORT of occupants.  our
   model is based on four strategies implemented and simulated using the
   3D_MODELING interface of the rhino/grasshopper visual programming tool.  the
   CONTROL_SYSTEM of our OFFICE_BUILDING intends to meet the ansi/ashrae
   standard, which defines the THERMAL_COMFORT of occupants.  the proposed
   system takes into account the effect of DIFFERENT_HEAT_LOADS of a building,
   such as EQUIPMENT_LOAD, LIGHTING density, and the number of people per area.
   our machine to machine communication based approach is capable of reducing
   ENERGY_CONSUMPTION while keeping the occupants thermally comfortable.
   consequently, the ANNUAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION has been reduced by an average
   of 16% at DIFFERENT_SETPOINTS of the HVAC_SYSTEM.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB cost effective ENERGY_EFFICIENCY improvements in RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS can
   realize 30% energy reduction within this ENERGY_SECTOR for the usa.
   unfortunately, audits on residences to IDENTIFY_POTENTIAL_SAVINGS, generally
   based on detailed ENERGY_MODELS, tend to over estimate anticipated savings.
   this leads to wariness on the part of POTENTIAL_INVESTORS. we address this
   issue by taking an integrated data  and physics based approach, using
   RESIDENTIAL_BUILDING_GEOMETRICAL and ENERGY_SYSTEM_CHARACTERISTICS (e.g.,
   envelope, appliances, and HVAC_SYSTEMS), as well as
   HISTORICAL_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION for each residence and WEATHER_DATA, to
   predict MONTHLY_NATURAL_GAS_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and savings from the adoption
   of INDIVIDUAL_ENERGY saving measures.  this approach requires only those
   geometrical and ENERGY_SYSTEM_CHARACTERISTICS associated with the greatest
   potential for realized savings which are also easy to obtain.  we construct
   a dataset from a collection of houses with a WIDE_RANGE of
   ENERGY_EFFECTIVENESS, and train a single STATISTICAL_MODEL that accurately
   predicts NATURAL_GAS_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION in any of the INDIVIDUAL_RESIDENCES.
   the model is then used to estimate the savings from most
   IMPACTFUL_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_INVESTMENTS for INDIVIDUAL_RESIDENCES, as well
   as the collective grouping.  the SPECIFIC_CASE considered here
   INVOLVES_HUNDREDS of university owned STUDENT_RESIDENCES in the u.s.
   MIDWEST. the resulting MACHINE_LEARNING derived model is used to predict
   MONTHLY_NATURAL_GAS_CONSUMPTION with a mean squared error of 0.00023 for
   unitary scaled cross validation data.  we use a nearest NEIGHBOR_APPROACH to
   VALIDATE_SAVINGS_ESTIMATES for virtually improved residences, identifying
   the SURROGATE_RESIDENCE most like an improved residence.  this
   VALIDATION_DEMONSTRATES a SAVINGS_PREDICTION_ACCURACY to within 3.5% for
   most of the measures considered.  the validated models are shown capable of
   prioritizing INVESTMENTS among the collective of residences considered.
   SEQUENTIAL_ADOPTION of the most cost effective ENERGY_EFFICIENCY measure
   among a group of RESIDENCES_RENDERS a TOTAL_ENERGY_REDUCTION of 36%. the
   PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS of this research are significant.  this integrated
   MACHINE_LEARNING and physics based approach to ESTIMATE_SAVINGS could be
   used in any UTILITY_DISTRICT and throughout all of the usa to enable
   district wide RESIDENTIAL_ENERGY_REDUCTION based upon SEQUENTIAL_ADOPTION of

AB the KEY_DIRECTION of POLITICAL_ACTIONS in the field of
   SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of the ENERGY_SECTOR and economy is the process of
   ENERGY_TRANSFORMATION (DECARBONIZATION) and increasing the share of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (res) in the supply of PRIMARY_ENERGY. regardless
   of the INDISPUTABLE_ADVANTAGES, res are referred to as
   UNSTABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. a POSSIBLE_SOLUTION might be the development of the
   concept of HYDROGEN_SUPPLY_CHAINS, especially the so called GREEN_HYDROGEN
   obtained in the process of electrolysis from electricity produced from res.
   the aim of the research undertaken in the article is to identify the scope
   of research carried out in the area of HYDROGEN_SUPPLY_CHAINS and to link
   this research with the issues of the operation of
   ELECTRICITY_DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS powered by res.  as a result of the
   SCOPING_REVIEW, and the application of the TEXT_MINING method using the
   IRAMUTEQ_TOOL, which includes the analysis of the content of 12
   REVIEW_ARTICLES presenting the CURRENT_RESEARCH_ACHIEVEMENTS in this field
   over the last three years (20162020), it was established that the issues
   related to HYDROGEN_SUPPLY_CHAINS, including GREEN_HYDROGEN, are still not

AB the currently existing ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL_OPTIMIZATION for
   HYBRID_ELECTRIC_VEHICLE (hev) mainly focuses on FUEL_ECONOMY. apart from
   this, there has been some consideration of the impact of emissions, but
   almost no attention has been paid to DRIVABILITY_PERFORMANCE. therefore,
   from the point of view of MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION, the influences of
   FUEL_ECONOMY, emission and DRIVABILITY_PERFORMANCE on the ENERGY_MANAGEMENT
   are comprehensively considered for a PARALLEL_HEV. the
   ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL_PARAMETERS and DRIVELINE_PARAMETERS are selected
   to be optimized parameters.  then, the NSGA_II (fast
   NON_DOMINATED_SORTING_GENETIC_ALGORITHM_II) algorithm is proposed to solve
   the MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION problem.  furthermore, the
   MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION method for HEV_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT_CONTROL is
   established and comparatively simulated with the parallel
   ELECTRIC_ASSIST_CONTROL_STRATEGY. the results show that the EVALUATION_INDEX
   of DRIVABILITY_DECREASES by 27.12% from the maximum and the
   AVERAGE_ENHANCEMENT_EFFECT of optimization falls by 20.84%. the
   EVALUATION_INDEX of FUEL_ECONOMY declines by 22.30% from the maximum and the
   AVERAGE_INDEX_DROPS by 20.26%. the COMPREHENSIVE_INDEX of
   EMISSION_PERFORMANCE_DESCENDS by 11.33% from the maximum.  the proposed
   MULTI_OBJECTIVES_OPTIMIZATION algorithm has GOOD_CONVERGENCE and
   distribution, and obtains more PARETO_OPTIMAL_SOLUTION sets, which can
   provide more selectivity in building

   two EXPERT_SYSTEMS: the CARBON_DIOXIDE_CAPTURE monitoring and diagnostic
   (cdcmd) system and the knowledge based system for CARBON_DIOXIDE_CAPTURE
   (kbscdc). the CDCMD_SYSTEM was implemented on g2, which is an intelligent
   real time system development platform, but the system was found to be
   deficient.  hence, the kbscdc was developed on DELTAVTM_SIMULATE to address
   the weaknesses of the CDCMD_SYSTEM. the KNOWLEDGE_BASE of the kbscdc
   includes more SYSTEMATIC_DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE and problem solving strategies
   than that of the CDCMD_SYSTEM. furthermore, the kbscdc can
   SIMULATE_CONTROL_STRATEGIES that can be applied to the FIELD_DEVICES. both

AB SMART_GRIDS are rapidly replacing CONVENTIONAL_NETWORKS on a
   WORLDWIDE_SCALE. a SMART_GRID has drawbacks, just like any other
   NOVEL_TECHNOLOGY. a SMART_GRID_CYBERATTACK is one of the most
   CHALLENGING_THINGS to stop.  the biggest problem is caused by millions of
   sensors constantly sending and receiving DATA_PACKETS over the network.
   CYBERATTACKS can compromise the SMART_GRIDS_DEPENDABILITY, availability, and
   privacy.  users, the COMMUNICATION_NETWORK of SMART_DEVICES and sensors, and
   NETWORK_ADMINISTRATORS are the three layers of an INNOVATIVE_GRID_NETWORK
   vulnerable to CYBERATTACKS. in this study, we look at the many risks and
   flaws that can affect the safety of critical,
   INNOVATIVE_GRID_NETWORK_COMPONENTS. then, to protect against these dangers,
   we offer SECURITY_SOLUTIONS using DIFFERENT_METHODS. we also provide
   recommendations for reducing the chance that these three categories of
   CYBERATTACKS may occur.  2023 by the authors.

AB since the depletion of FOSSIL_FUELS, the world has started to rely heavily
   on RENEWABLE_SOURCES of energy.  with every passing year, our dependency on
   RENEWABLE_SOURCES of energy is increasing exponentially.  as a result,
   complex and HYBRID_GENERATION_SYSTEMS are being developed to meet the
   ENERGY_DEMANDS and ENSURE_ENERGY_SECURITY in a country.  the
   CONTINUAL_IMPROVEMENT in the technology and an effort toward the provision
   of uninterrupted power to the end users is strongly dependent on an
   effective and fault resilient operation & maintenance (o&m) system.
   INGENIOUS_ALGORITHMS and techniques are hence been introduced aiming to
   MINIMIZE_EQUIPMENT and PLANT_DOWNTIME. efforts are being made to develop
   ROBUST_PROGNOSTIC_MAINTENANCE_SYSTEMS that can identify the faults before
   they occur.  to this aim, COMPLEX_DATA_ANALYTICS and ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
   (ai) algorithms are being used to increase the OVERALL_EFFICIENCY of these
   PROGNOSTIC_MAINTENANCE_SYSTEMS. this paper provides an overview of the

PY 2022
AB COMBINED_HEAT_AND_POWER (chp) plants are known as EFFICIENT_TECHNOLOGIES to
   reduce ENVIRONMENTAL_EMISSIONS, BALANCE_ENERGY_COSTS, and
   INCREASE_TOTAL_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY. to obtain a more EFFICIENT_SYSTEM,
   VARIOUS_OPTIMIZATION_METHODS have been employed, based on numerical,
   experimental, parametric, and ALGORITHMIC_OPTIMIZATION_ROUTES. due to the
   significance of ALGORITHMIC_OPTIMIZATION, as a SYSTEMATIC_METHOD for
   optimizing ENERGY_SYSTEMS, this NOVEL_REVIEW_PAPER is focused on the
   META_HEURISTIC OPTIMIZATION algorithms, implemented in CHP_ENERGY_SYSTEMS.
   by considering the applied OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS, the MAIN_SECTIONS are
   divided into SINGLE_OBJECTIVE and multi objective algorithms.  in each case,
   the UNITS_COMBINATION is briefly detailed, the OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS are
   introduced, and analyses are conducted.  the MAIN_AIM of this paper is to
   gather a database for the OPTIMIZATION of chps, demonstrate the effect of
   the applied OPTIMIZATION_METHODS on the OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS, and finally,
   introduce the most EFFICIENT_METHODS. the most significant feature of this
   paper is that it covers all types of CHP_OPTIMIZATION_ISSUES including
   SCHEDULING, sizing, and designing problems, finding the extent of each
   OPTIMIZATION_ISSUE in the RELEVANT_PAPERS in the last decade.  based on the
   findings, in the SINGLE_OBJECTIVE problems the COMBINED_HEAT_AND_POWER
   ECONOMIC_DISPATCH (chped) issue as a subcategory of the SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS
   is introduced as the most paid topic; the DESIGNING_ISSUE is known as the
   lowest paid topic.  in the multi objective problems, working on
   VARIOUS_TYPES of CHP_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEMS has been conducted with an almost
   SIMILAR_SHARE. the COMBINED_HEAT_AND_POWER ECONOMIC_EMISSION_DISPATCH
   (chpeed) problem with the most share, and the sizing issue with the lowest
   share.  the chp designing and sizing OPTIMIZATION_ISSUES could be introduced
   as topics to work on more in the future.  additionally, the
   NUMERICAL_RESULTS of chped and chpeed problems solved by VARIOUS_ALGORITHMS

AB INDIVIDUAL_MICROGRIDS can improve the reliability of POWER_SYSTEMS during

   through RESOURCE_SHARING and increase the resilience of critical end use
   loads.  however, networked MICROGRID_OPERATIONS can be subject to
   LARGE_TRANSIENTS due to switching and end use loads, which can cause
   DYNAMIC_INSTABILITY and lead to SYSTEM_COLLAPSE. these transients are
   especially prevalent in MICROGRIDS with HIGH_PENETRATIONS of grid following
   inverter connected RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES, which do not provide the
   SYSTEM_INERTIA or FAST_FREQUENCY_RESPONSE needed to mitigate the transients.
   one POTENTIAL_MITIGATION is to engage the existing GENERATOR_CONTROLS to
   reduce SYSTEM_VOLTAGE in response to a FREQUENCY_DEVIATION, thereby reducing
   load and improving PRIMARY_FREQUENCY_RESPONSE. this STUDY_INVESTIGATES the
   use of a REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based controller trained over several
   SWITCHING_TRANSIENT scenarios to MODIFY_GENERATOR controls during

   deep q network (dqn) is proposed to cope with the challenge.  firstly, a
   GRAY_MODEL is used to predict the TRAFFIC_CONGESTION of each road and the
   length of each road calculated in the TRADITIONAL_DIJKSTRAS_ALGORITHM (da)
   is modified for PATH_PLANNING. secondly, on the basis of the predicted
   velocity of each road, the planned velocity is constrained by the
   VEHICLE_DYNAMICS to ensure the driving security.  finally, the
   PLANNING_INFORMATION is inputted to dqn to control the WORKING_MODE of
   ipshev, so as to achieve energy saving of the vehicle.  the

AU Phanikumar C; Agarwal V; El Moursi MS

SO IET Power Electronics
PY 2020
AB in this study, a new self balancing 7 level inverter (sb7li) TOPOLOGY,
   suitable for interfacing the LOW_VOLTAGE_RENEWABLES with the POWER_GRID, is
   proposed that uses coupled inductors to generate ADDITIONAL_LEVELS in the
   OUTPUT_VOLTAGE. owing to the presence of a self balancing circuit, the
   voltage across the two INPUT_DC_CAPACITORS is self balanced by charging them
   in series and discharging them in parallel.  the self balancing feature of
   the proposed sb7li also obviates the sensing of INPUT_DC_CAPACITORS'
   voltages.  the sb7li is controlled using a novel multi sine wave pulse width
   modulation strategy.  a SIGNIFICANT_ADVANTAGE of the proposed sb7li TOPOLOGY
   is that it uses fewer POWER_COMPONENTS in comparison with traditional multi
   level inverter topologies, which ensures higher POWER_DENSITY and
   COMPACT_CIRCUITS. this also improves the OVERALL_EFFICIENCY of the system
   and reduces the cost.  further, a modified version of the sb7li is also
   presented with a reduced number of POWER_COMPONENTS. an ADDITIONAL_ADVANTAGE
   of coupled inductors is their filtering action on the
   OUTPUT_VOLTAGE/current, which reduces the OVERALL_FILTER_REQUIREMENTS. sb7li
   can be easily extended to an n level, 3  application.  the proposed sb7li
   and modified sb7li are validated through simulations in MATLAB/simulink and

AB this paper presents a BRIEF_SURVEY of RECENT_WORKS on iterative learning
   control (ilc) of energy management system (ems) based on a framework of
   multi agent system (mas). ilc is a control methodology which is especially
   suitable for dynamical systems whose control tasks are executed in a finite
   time interval and are repeated over and over.  the key idea of ilc is to
   take AVAILABLE_SYSTEM_INFORMATION in the past and current runs, to generate
   the control input for the next run.  ems is a computer based system to
   monitor energy consumption, control operation, and OPTIMIZE_ENERGY_SUPPLIES
   and demands.  ems can be naturally modeled as mas since each power generated
   or powerconsumed component of ems can be cast as agent.  each agent of mas
   is a dynamical system itself and has its OWN_TARGET such as tracking desired
   trajectory and minimizing energy.  moreover, there are common objectives of
   ems which aim to attain its energy efficiency, reliability and optimality.
   then one agent can cooperate with other agents to achieve some global
   objectives, in addition to their OWN_LOCAL_GOALS, by exchanging information
   with other agents.  lastly, we will explore some OPEN_RESEARCH_PROBLEMS and

AB microgrids (mgs) are capable to work at DIFFERENT_OPERATION_MODES, namely
   grid connected or islanded, which make a significant change in the
   NETWORK_FAULT CURRENT_LEVEL. these changes may lead to problems and should
   be detected fast to do the PROPER_PROTECTION_ACTIONS accordingly and prevent
   blackouts.  moreover, some ISLAND_DETECTION_METHODS_SUFFER from the
   drawbacks of HIGH_COMPUTATION_BURDEN and time consuming procedure of
   TRAINING_DATA to detect the islanded mode.  for this purpose, in this paper,
   a faster and less COMPUTATION_BURDEN_ISLAND_DETECTION_SCHEME without the
   need for TRAINING_DATA is proposed which detects the islanded mode by
   analyzing the fault CURRENT_DATA obtained from a continuous sampling using
   the PHASOR_MEASUREMENT_UNIT (pmu). the sampled data are utilized in the
   fuzzy c means (fcm) clustering to determine the NETWORK_OPERATION_MODE. the
   proposed scheme works in two phases.  in the OFFLINE_PHASE, the root mean
   square (rms) of the CURRENT_AMPLITUDE for islanded mode is determined, and
   in the ONLINE_PHASE, the center of the measured data is compared to the
   RMS_VALUE to detect the MG_OPERATION_MODE at a DECISION_MAKING_PROCEDURE. it
   is proved that the proposed ISLAND_DETECTION_SCHEME is an

TI drdc: DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING based DUTY_CYCLE for

AU Mohammadi R; Shirmohammadi Z
TC 1
SO Energy Reports
PY 2023
AB nowadays, WIRELESS_BODY_AREA_NETWORKS are the center of attention for
   PATIENTS_HEALTH_DATA monitoring.  in these networks, the SENSOR_NODES deal
   with the limited ENERGY of batteries to provide SUSTAINABLE_SERVICES.
   unlimited ENERGY supply by ENERGY_HARVESTERS in these nodes as complementary
   to batteries makes perform in a STABLE_STATE. however, the harvested ENERGY
   has an irregular and UNPREDICTABLE_RATE. when the data sensed by the sensor
   is stable, the CONTINUOUS_ACTIVITY of the ENERGY_HARVESTING BODY_NODE (eh
   bn) is necessary.  also, it can fully discharge the eh bn ENERGY if the
   HARVESTABLE_ENERGY_RATE is low.  therefore, it is required that eh bn to be
   in sleep and WAKE_MODES periodically to adjust the DUTY_CYCLE for eh bn.
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS perform nicely in determining the
   DUTY_CYCLE under UNCERTAIN_CONDITIONS. previous rl based methods for
   determining the bn's DUTY_CYCLE have two FUNDAMENTAL_PROBLEMS: (1)
   BN_SUFFERS from the EMERGENCY_PACKET_LOSS or unnecessary frequent sleeping
   and waking, and (2) discretization of the PROBLEM_SPACE does not ensure the
   determination of the OPTIMAL_DUTY_CYCLE. this paper proposes a NEW_METHOD
   for determining the eh bn's DUTY_CYCLE based on DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING
   (drdc). the novelties of drdc are as follows: (1) considers the CHANGE_RATE
   of data sensed by bn in addition to its ENERGY to avoid the
   EMERGENCY_PACKET_LOSS and unnecessary frequent sleep/wake, (2) uses deep q
   network (dqn) with LIGHT_NEURAL_NETWORK for accurately determining bn's
   DUTY_CYCLE, (3) applies a three layer communication ARCHITECTURAL_MODEL when
   there are EXTREME_LIMITATIONS in BN_RESOURCES to preserve the
   MEMORY_CONSTRAINTS and COMPUTATIONAL_POWER of eh bn.  in this
   ARCHITECTURAL_MODEL, the algorithm is executed on a LOCAL_SERVER, and only
   the trained policy is transmitted to eh bn.  (4) designs a REWARD_FUNCTION
   to realize the SUITABLE_PERFORMANCE of the DQN_ALGORITHM. this function
   simultaneously depends on the eh bn ENERGY, CHANGE_RATE of the sensed data,
   and SLEEP_TIME and can balance these parameters.  results of simulations
   suggest that the proposed METHOD_DECREASES the eh bn DUTY_CYCLE by about 28%
   and the DATA_OVERHEAD by more than 50% on average relative to
   SIMILAR_STUDIES.  2023 the authors

AB in this paper, a genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the sizing of an
   autonomous renewable energy multi source system for reliable and economical
   supply of energy.  the multi source system is composed of a photovoltaic
   generator, a pumped STORAGE_HYDROPOWER_SYSTEM and a BATTERY. the system will
   power public lighting and operate a garden fountain in the BOTANICAL_GARDEN,
   located in the ALEXANDRE_AIBEO_PARK in covilha (portugal). SOLAR_IRRADIANCE
   is initially simulated for a reference photovoltaic capacity (25 kwp) over
   one year by the pvsyst software for the city of covilha.  two objective
   functions are used for sizing optimization: the loss of power supply
   probability (lpsp) and the levelized cost of energy (lce). the lce takes
   into account the CAPITAL_COST, the replacement cost and the cost of
   operation and maintenance.  the genetic algorithm is used to determine the
   best configuration of the different subsystems (photovoltaic generator
   capacity, UPPER_WATER_RESERVOIR_CAPACITY and BATTERY_CAPACITY). the
   originality of this work lies in the combination of two STORAGE_ELEMENTS
   with different dynamics, the introduction of an adapted energy management
   strategy (ems) allowing to manage energy flows between the different
   subsystems and to control the process of CHARGING/ discharging
   STORAGE_ELEMENTS, and multi objective optimization (considering technical

   existing solutions generally MONITOR_POWER_TERMINAL_DEVICES by monitoring
   POWER_TERMINAL_TRAFFIC; however, SUCH_SECURITY_POLICIES can only
   MONITOR_ATTACKS with CHARACTERIZATION_PROPERTIES at the TRAFFIC_LEVEL and
   cannot be used to MONITOR_POWER_TERMINAL_DEVICES directly.  based on this,
   this paper reviewed the literature on INTELLIGENT_OPERATION and MAINTENANCE
   and DEEP_LEARNING at home and abroad and comprehensively analyzed the
   RESEARCH_PROGRESS of INTELLIGENT_OPERATION and MAINTENANCE, and in the
   COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS of DEEP_LEARNING_METHODS, because the
   CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK has fewer connections and parameters and can
   control the capacity by controlling its depth and width, it is convenient to
   establish a model with larger LEARNING_CAPACITY, so a
   CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK is chosen for DATA_ANALYSIS. in this study, we
   choose to use the CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK to analyze the data, combine

   MAINTENANCE_WORK organically through some DEEP_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS, reduce
   the number of MODEL_LAYERS through a DEEP_LEARNING based security monitoring
   technology for ELECTRIC_POWER_TERMINALS to improve the training speed and

PY 2020
AB with the FAST_DEVELOPMENT of cloud computing methods, EXPONENTIAL_GROWTH is
   faced by several users.  it is complicated for TRADITIONAL_DATA_CENTERS to
   perform several jobs in real time because of INADEQUATE_BANDWIDTH_RESOURCES.
   therefore, the method of FOG_COMPUTING is recommended for supporting and
   providing fast CLOUD_SERVICES. it is not a substitute but is a
   POWERFUL_COMPLEMENT to cloud computing.  the reduction of ENERGY_CONSUMPTION
   through the notion of FOG_COMPUTING has certainly been a challenge for
   CURRENT_RESEARCHERS, industries, and communities.  VARIOUS_INDUSTRIES,
   including finance and healthcare, require a rich resource based platform for
   processing LARGE_AMOUNTS of data with cloud computing across
   FOG_ARCHITECTURE. the consumption of energy across FOG_SERVERS_RELIES on
   allocating techniques for services (USER_REQUESTS). it
   FACILITATES_PROCESSING at the edge with the probability of interacting with
   the cloud.  this article proposed energy aware scheduling by using
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) and modified MULTIOBJECTIVE_JOB_SCHEDULING
   (mmjs) techniques.  the emphasis of the work is on the reduction of
   ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_RATE with less SERVICE_LEVEL_AGREEMENT (sla) violation in
   FOG_COMPUTING for DATA_CENTERS. the RESULT_SHOWS that there is a 3.9%
   reduction in SLA_VIOLATION when a MULTIOBJECTIVE_FUNCTION with
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK is applied.  2020 BENTHAM_SCIENCE_PUBLISHERS.

AB with the rise in electricity, gas and oil prices and the persistently high
   levels of CARBON_EMISSIONS, there is an increasing demand for
   EFFECTIVE_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT in ENERGY_SYSTEMS, including ELECTRICAL_GRIDS.
   recent literature exhibits large potential for optimizing the behavior of
   SUCH_SYSTEMS towards ENERGY_PERFORMANCE, reducing peak loads and exploiting
   environmentally FRIENDLY_WAYS for ENERGY_PRODUCTION. however, the primary
   challenge relies on the optimization of SUCH_SYSTEMS, which introduces
   SIGNIFICANT_COMPLEXITIES since they present quite DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR.
   SUCH_CYBERPHYSICAL_FRAMEWORKS usually integrate multiple interconnected
   components such as power plants, TRANSMISSION_LINES, DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS
   and VARIOUS_TYPES of energy storage systems, while the behavior of these
   components is affected by VARIOUS_EXTERNAL_FACTORS such as user individual
   requirements, WEATHER_CONDITIONS, ENERGY_DEMAND and market prices.
   consequently, TRADITIONAL_OPTIMAL_CONTROL_APPROACHESSUCH as rule based
   control (rbc)prove inadequate to deal with the DIVERSE_DYNAMICS which define
   the behavior of such complicated frameworks.  moreover, even
   SOPHISTICATED_TECHNIQUESSUCH as model predictive control (mpc)showcase model
   related limitations that hinder the applicability of an optimal control
   scheme.  to this end, ai model free techniques such as reinforcement
   learning (rl) offer a FRUITFUL_POTENTIAL for embedding
   EFFICIENT_OPTIMAL_CONTROL in cases of ENERGY_SYSTEMS. recent studies present
   promising results in VARIOUS_FIELDS of engineering, indicating that
   RL_FRAMEWORKS may prove the key element for delivering
   EFFICIENT_OPTIMAL_CONTROL in SMART_BUILDINGS, ELECTRIC_VEHICLE charging and
   SMART_GRID_APPLICATIONS. the CURRENT_PAPER provides a COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW

AB given the merits of AFFORDABLE_COST, superior LOW_TEMPERATURE_PERFORMANCE,
   and advanced SAFE_PROPERTIES, SODIUM_ION_BATTERIES (sibs) have exhibited
   GREAT_DEVELOPMENT_POTENTIAL in LARGE_SCALE_ENERGY_STORAGE_APPLICATIONS.
   among various emerging CARBONACEOUS_ANODE_MATERIALS applied for sibs,
   HARD_CARBON (hc) has recently gained SIGNIFICANT_ATTENTION regarding their
   relatively low cost, WIDE_AVAILABILITY, and OPTIMAL_OVERALL_PERFORMANCE.
   however, the insufficient INITIAL_COULOMBIC_EFFICIENCY (ice) of hc is the
   MAIN_BOTTLENECKS, which is inevitably hindering their further
   COMMERCIAL_APPLICATIONS. herein, an in depth holistic exposition about the
   reasons causing the unsatisfied ice and the RECENT_ADVANCES on
   EFFECTIVE_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGIES are comprehensively summarized in this
   review, which have been divided into two aspects including the
   INTRINSIC_PROPERTY (degree of graphitization, PORE_STRUCTURE, defect, et
   al.) and the EXTRINSIC_FACTOR (electrolyte, ELECTRODE_MATERIALS, et al.). in
   addition, FUTURE_PROSPECTS and perspectives on hc to
   ENABLE_PRACTICAL_APPLICATION in sibs are also briefly outlined.  2023 wiley

PY 2022
AB FORECASTING_ELECTRICITY LOAD_DEMAND is critical for POWER_SYSTEM_PLANNING
   and ENERGY_MANAGEMENT. in particular, accurate SHORT_TERM_LOAD_FORECASTING
   (stlf), which focuses on the LEAD_TIME_HORIZON of few minutes to one week
   ahead, can help in better LOAD_SCHEDULING, UNIT_COMMITMENT, and cost
   effective operation of SMART_POWER_GRIDS. in the last decade,
   DIFFERENT_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) based techniques and
   METAHEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS have been utilized for stlf by the researchers and
   scientists with varying degrees of accuracy and efficacy.  despite the
   benefits of implemented methods for stlf, many drawbacks and associated
   problems have also been observed and reported by the researchers.  this
   paper provides a COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of hybrid deep LEARNING_MODELS based
   on nature inspired METAHEURISTIC_TECHNIQUES for stlf with respect to the
   analysis of the results and accuracy.  moreover, it also provides the
   RESEARCH_FINDINGS and gaps that will assist the researchers to have an
   EARLY_AWARENESS of all IMPORTANT_BENEFITS and drawbacks of these integrated
   STLF_METHODS scientifically and systematically.  especially, the hybrid
   forecast models using artificial intelligence based methods for SMART_GRIDS
   are focused.  several PERFORMANCE_INDICES are used to compare and report the
   accuracy of these techniques including mean ABSOLUTE_PERCENTAGE_ERROR
   (mape). multiple other parametric and exogenous VARIABLE_DETAILS have also
   been focused to figure out the potential of the INTELLIGENT_LOAD FORECASTING
   techniques from the perspective of SMART_POWER_GRIDS.   2022 BADAR_UL_ISLAM

   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK type MANAGEMENT_STRATEGY, ensuring POWER_SHARING
   between sources, HYDRAULIC_COMPONENTS, and TANK_STORAGE. the MAIN_OBJECTIVE
   of the MANAGEMENT_STRATEGY is to deliver and purify as much freshwater as
   possible by taking advantage of all the energy available according to
   CLIMATIC_CONDITIONS. a PARAMETRIC_SENSITIVITY_ALGORITHM is developed to find
   the most APPROPRIATE_NEURAL_NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE. a DYNAMIC_SIMULATOR for 1
   year of OPERATION_INTEGRATES the ENERGY_MANAGEMENT of the system is
   developed.  the used WATER_ENERGY management based ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK
   showed GOOD_RESULTS of POWER_SHARING during a FAST_TIME with a
   CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT and a coefficient of determination between the
   actual and estimated values of the three MOTOR_PUMPS ELECTRICAL_POWER equal
   to 96% and 98%, respectively.  also, the root mean squared error was
   acceptable at 0.1476. these results have been proved over a year and can be
   used by other researchers with a SIMILAR_SYSTEM.  2022 AMERICAN_INSTITUTE of
