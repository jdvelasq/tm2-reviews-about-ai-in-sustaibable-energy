Title: a review of DEEP_LEARNING for RENEWABLE_ENERGY FORECASTING
Abstract:
```
as RENEWABLE_ENERGY becomes increasingly popular in the \
GLOBAL_ELECTRIC_ENERGY_GRID, improving the accuracy of RENEWABLE_ENERGY \
FORECASTING is critical to POWER_SYSTEM_PLANNING, management, and \
operations. however, this is a CHALLENGING_TASK due to the intermittent \
and CHAOTIC_NATURE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_DATA. to date, VARIOUS_METHODS \
have been developed, including PHYSICAL_MODELS, STATISTICAL_METHODS, \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNIQUES, and their hybrids to improve the \
FORECASTING_ACCURACY of RENEWABLE_ENERGY. among them, DEEP_LEARNING, as a \
PROMISING_TYPE of MACHINE_LEARNING capable for discovering the \
INHERENT_NONLINEAR features and high level invariant structures in data, \
has been frequently reported in the literature. this paper provides a \
comprehensive and EXTENSIVE_REVIEW of RENEWABLE_ENERGY FORECASTING \
methods based on DEEP_LEARNING to explore its effectiveness, efficiency \
and APPLICATION_POTENTIAL. we divide the existing deterministic and \
PROBABILISTIC_FORECASTING methods based on DEEP_LEARNING into four \
groups, namely DEEP_BELIEF_NETWORK, stack auto encoder, \
DEEP_RECURRENT_NEURAL_NETWORK and others. we also dissect the \
FEASIBLE_DATA preprocessing techniques and error post correction methods \
to improve the FORECASTING_ACCURACY. EXTENSIVE_ANALYSIS and discussion of \
VARIOUS_DEEP_LEARNING based FORECASTING methods are given. finally, we \
explore the CURRENT_RESEARCH_ACTIVITIES, challenges and potential \
FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS in this topic.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: predicting the state of charge and health of batteries using data driven \
MACHINE_LEARNING
Abstract:
```
MACHINE_LEARNING is a SPECIFIC_APPLICATION of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE \
that allows computers to learn and improve from data and experience via \
sets of algorithms, without the need for reprogramming. in the field of \
ENERGY_STORAGE, MACHINE_LEARNING has recently emerged as a promising \
modelling approach to determine the state of charge, STATE_OF_HEALTH and \
remaining USEFUL_LIFE of batteries. first, we review the two most studied \
types of BATTERY_MODELS in the literature for BATTERY_STATE_PREDICTION: \
the EQUIVALENT_CIRCUIT and PHYSICS_BASED_MODELS. based on the \
CURRENT_LIMITATIONS of these models, we showcase the promise of \
VARIOUS_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES for fast and \
ACCURATE_BATTERY_STATE_PREDICTION. finally, we highlight the major \
challenges involved, especially in accurate modelling over length and \
time, performing in SITU_CALCULATIONS and HIGH_THROUGHPUT_DATA \
generation. overall, this work provides insights into real time, \
EXPLAINABLE_MACHINE_LEARNING for BATTERY_PRODUCTION, management and \
optimization in the future.  2020, SPRINGER_NATURE limited.

Title: machine learning applied to electrified VEHICLE_BATTERY_STATE of charge \
and STATE_OF_HEALTH estimation: state of the art
Abstract:
```
the growing interest and recent breakthroughs in ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE \
and machine learning (ml) have actively contributed to an increase in \
RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT of new methods to estimate the states of \
electrified VEHICLE_BATTERIES. data driven approaches, such as ml, are \
becoming more popular for estimating the STATE_OF_CHARGE (soc) and \
STATE_OF_HEALTH (soh) due to greater availability of BATTERY_DATA and \
improved computing power capabilities. this paper provides a survey of \
battery STATE_ESTIMATION_METHODS based on ml approaches such as \
feedforward neural networks (fnns), RECURRENT_NEURAL_NETWORKS (rnns), \
SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES (svm), radial basis functions (rbf), and hamming \
networks. comparisons between methods are shown in terms of data quality, \
inputs and outputs, TEST_CONDITIONS, battery types, and stated accuracy \
to give readers a bigger picture view of the ml landscape for soc and \
SOH_ESTIMATION. additionally, to provide insight into how to best \
approach with the comparison of different neural network structures, an \
fnn and long short term memory (lstm) rnn are trained fifty times each \
for 3000 epochs. the error is somewhat different for each \
TRAINING_REPETITION due to the random initial values of the \
TRAINABLE_PARAMETERS, demonstrating that it is important to \
TRAIN_NETWORKS multiple times to achieve the best result. furthermore, it \
is recommended that when performing a comparison among estimation \
techniques such as those presented in this REVIEW_PAPER, the compared \
networks should have a SIMILAR_NUMBER of learnable parameters and be \
trained and tested with identical data. otherwise, it is difficult to \
make a general conclusion regarding the quality of a given estimation \
technique.  2013 ieee.

Title: PRELITHIATION: a CRUCIAL_STRATEGY for boosting the PRACTICAL_APPLICATION \
of next generation lithium ion BATTERY
Abstract:
```
with the URGENT_MARKET_DEMAND for high energydensity batteries, the alloy \
type or conversion type ANODES with HIGH_SPECIFIC_CAPACITY have gained \
increasing attention to replace current low specific capacity GRAPHITE \
based ANODES. however, alloy type and conversion type ANODES have \
LARGE_INITIAL_IRREVERSIBLE_CAPACITY compared with GRAPHITE based ANODES, \
which consume most of the li+ in the CORRESPONDING_CATHODE and severely \
reduces the ENERGY_DENSITY of FULL_CELLS. therefore, for the \
PRACTICAL_APPLICATION of these high capacity ANODES, it is urgent to \
develop a commercially AVAILABLE_PRELITHIATION_TECHNIQUE to compensate \
for their LARGE_INITIAL_IRREVERSIBLE_CAPACITY. at present, \
VARIOUS_PRELITHIATION_METHODS for compensating the \
INITIAL_IRREVERSIBLE_CAPACITY of the ANODE have been reported, but due to \
their RESPECTIVE_SHORTCOMINGS, large scale COMMERCIAL_APPLICATIONS have \
not yet been achieved. in this review, we have systematically summarized \
and analyzed the advantages and challenges of \
VARIOUS_PRELITHIATION_METHODS, providing enlightenment for the further \
development of each PRELITHIATION_STRATEGY toward commercialization and \
thus facilitating the PRACTICAL_APPLICATION of HIGH_SPECIFIC_CAPACITY \
ANODES in the next generation HIGH_ENERGY_DENSITY lithiumion batteries. \

```
MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) is emerging as a POWERFUL_APPROACH that has \
recently shown potential to affect VARIOUS_FRONTIERS of CARBON_CAPTURE, a \
KEY_INTERIM_TECHNOLOGY to assist in the mitigation of CLIMATE_CHANGE. in \
this perspective, we reveal how ML_IMPLEMENTATIONS have improved this \
process in many aspects, for both ABSORPTION  and ADSORPTION based \
approaches, ranging from the molecular to PROCESS_LEVEL. we discuss the \
role of ml in predicting the THERMODYNAMIC_PROPERTIES of absorbents and \
in improving the ABSORPTION_PROCESS. for ADSORPTION_PROCESSES, we discuss \
the promises of ML_TECHNIQUES for exploring many options to find the most \
cost effective process scheme, which involves choosing a SOLID_ADSORBENT \
and designing a PROCESS_CONFIGURATION. we also highlight the advantages \
of ml and the associated risks, elaborate on the importance of the \
features needed to TRAIN_ML_MODELS, and identify \
PROMISING_FUTURE_OPPORTUNITIES for ml in CARBON_CAPTURE processes.  2021 \

STATE_OF_CHARGE_ESTIMATION of lithium ion battery
Abstract:
```
with the increasing CARBON_EMISSIONS_WORLDWIDE, LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES \
have become the MAIN_COMPONENT of ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS for CLEAN_ENERGY \
due to their UNIQUE_ADVANTAGES. accurate and reliable state of charge \
(soc) estimation is a CENTRAL_FACTOR in the WIDESPREAD_USE of \
LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES. this review, therefore, examines the \
RECENT_LITERATURE on estimating the soc of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES using \
the HYBRID_METHODS of NEURAL_NETWORKS combined with KALMAN_FILTERING (nn \
kf), classifying the methods into KALMAN_FILTER first and NEURAL_NETWORK \
first methods. then the HYBRID_METHODS are studied and discussed in terms \
of BATTERY_MODEL, PARAMETER_IDENTIFICATION, ALGORITHM_STRUCTURE, \
IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESS, APPROPRIATE_ENVIRONMENT, advantages, \
disadvantages, and ESTIMATION_ERRORS. in addition, this review also gives \
CORRESPONDING_RECOMMENDATIONS for researchers in the BATTERY_FIELD \

Title: the role of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in the MASS_ADOPTION of \
ELECTRIC_VEHICLES
Abstract:
```
the ELECTRIFICATION of MASS_TRANSPORTATION is hailed as a solution for \
reducing global GREENHOUSE_GAS emissions and dependence on \
UNSUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. the ANNUAL_SALES of ELECTRIC_VEHICLES (evs) \
has continued to rise since 2011, with a GLOBAL_SALE of evs of 2.1 \
million in 2019. this increase in SALES is mainly due to continued \
improvement in the cost and performance of COMMERCIAL_EVS, increased \
EV_OPTIONS available to consumers, and ENVIRONMENTAL_AWARENESS. however, \
despite the POSITIVE_OUTLOOK, evs still face major challenges that hinder \
their rapid and WIDESPREAD_ADOPTION: limited DRIVING_RANGE, long charging \
times, and a lack of sufficient charging INFRASTRUCTURE. this \
REVIEW_OUTLINES the RECENT_ADVANCES in evs and related INFRASTRUCTURE, \
mainly from ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai), which makes evs a more \
ATTRACTIVE_CONSUMER_OPTION. the application of ai in improving evs, \
facilitating EV_CHARGING_STATIONS, and EV_INTEGRATION with the SMART_GRID \
is critically analyzed and reviewed. finally, FUTURE_TRENDS and prospects \
in the area are discussed.  2021

Title: boosting the IONIC_CONDUCTIVITY of PEO_ELECTROLYTES by WASTE_EGGSHELL \
derived FILLERS for high performance solid LITHIUM/sodium batteries
Abstract:
```
POLY(ETHYLENE_OXIDE) (peo) based POLYMER_ELECTROLYTES are extensively \
investigated, and they have rapidly developed in \
ALL_SOLID_STATE_BATTERIES (assbs) over RECENT_YEARS for their \
GOOD_INTERFACE_CONTACT with electrodes, easy shaping and \
DECENT_FLEXIBILITY. however, their LOW_IONIC_CONDUCTIVITY remains a \
SERIOUS_ISSUE to be solved urgently. researchers have found that the \
addition of FILLERS can improve the ionic conductivityviacreating more \
AMORPHOUS_REGIONS_CONDUCIVE to ION_TRANSPORT in peo. here, we adopted \
WASTE_EGGSHELL as a precursor to prepare a sub micron filler, which is \
mainly cao, and it was added into the PEO_ELECTROLYTE to get a \
COMPOSITE_POLYMER_ELECTROLYTE. close contactvialewis base acid \
interaction between cao and peo can be obtained, as cao is an \
EFFECTIVE_FILLER with STRONG_ALKALINITY. to the best of our knowledge, \
this is the first time it is applied in the PEO_ELECTROLYTE. the filler \
significantly decreases the CRYSTALLINITY of peo, and hence, boosted \
IONIC_CONDUCTIVITY of the COMPOSITE_POLYMER_ELECTROLYTE is observed, \
which is about 4.5 times higher than that of the \
POLYMER_REFERENCE_ELECTROLYTE. it additionally brings a higher \
TENSILE_STRENGTH along with a more STABLE_ELECTROCHEMICAL_WINDOW (up to 5 \
v) to the COMPOSITE_ELECTROLYTE. therefore, as expected, the all solid \
state li/na battery with this COMPOSITE_ELECTROLYTE_EXHIBITS long cycling \
life and EXCELLENT_RATE_PERFORMANCES. the corresponding li/lifeo4battery \
has a STABLE_CAPACITY of 142.8 ma h g1at 1c after 200 cycles, and the \

Abstract:
```
nanobox structural fe7s8/mos2 CARBON_NANOFIBERS (nb fe7s8/mos2 cnfs) are \
synthesized by the process of electrospinning sulfuration hydrothermal, \
which construct a MULTIDIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE with 0d nanoparticles, 1d \
nanofibers, 2d nanosheets and 3d cross link networks. nb fe7s8/mos2 cnfs \
display the SPECIAL_DUAL confined effects, which are the space and \
INTERFACE_CONFINEMENT, respectively. benefiting from the advantage of \
MULTIDIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE, nb fe7s8/mos2 cnfs exhibit \
REMARKABLE_POTASSIUM_STORAGE_CAPABILITY and stable long cycle (~204.5 ma \
h g1 at 1 a g1 after 500 cycles). the STRUCTURE_EVOLUTION of nb \
fe7s8/mos2 cnfs in POTASSIUM_ION_BATTERIES (pibs) are explored by ex situ \
methods, which confirm that DUAL_CONFINED_EFFECT can alleviate the \
VOLUME_EXPANSION effectively. integrating the merits of \
MULTIDIMENSIONAL_STRUCTURE and dual confined effects, nb fe7s8/mos2 cnfs \
anode also manifests an OUTSTANDING_REVERSIBILITY and \
LONG_CYCLIC_STABILITY of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES (libs) (~772 ma h g1 at 1 \
a g1 after 500 cycles) and SODIUM_ION_BATTERIES (sibs) (~368.3 ma h g1 at \
1 a g1 after 500 cycles). additionally, the KINETIC_PROPERTIES have been \
studied, which explain the DIFFERENT_ION_MIGRATION_LAWS of \
ALKALI_METAL_ION_BATTERIES. the DENSITY_FUNCTION_THEORY (dft) calculation \
further verifies that HETEROGENEOUS_INTERFACES can greatly reduce the \

this aspect, determining a batterys remaining USABLE_LIFE (rul) \
establishes its efficacy. it also aids in the testing and development of \
VARIOUS_EV_UPGRADES by identifying factors that will increase and improve \
their efficiency. several nonlinear and complicated parameters are \
involved in the process. MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) methodologies have proven \
to be a PROMISING_TOOL for optimizing and modeling engineering challenges \
in this domain (non linearity and complexity). in contrast to the \

battery characteristics. in this paper, the method of the dynamic neural \
network is used to estimate the soc of the lithium ion batteries, which \
is improved based on the classic close loop nonlinear auto regressive \
models with exogenous input neural network (narxnn) model, and the open \
loop narxnn model considering expected output is proposed. since the \
input delay, feedback delay, and hidden layer of the dynamic neural \
network are usually selected by empirically, which affects the estimation \
PERFORMANCE of the dynamic neural network. to cover this weakness, \
SINE_COSINE_ALGORITHM (sca) is used for global optimal dynamic neural \
network parameters. then, the experimental results are verified to obtain \
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method under different \
conditions. finally, the dynamic neural network based on sca is compared \
with unscented kalman filter (ukf), back PROPAGATION_NEURAL_NETWORK based \
on particle swarm optimization (bpnn pso), least squares support vector \
machine (ls svm), and gaussian process regression (gpr), the results show \
that the proposed dynamic neural network based on sca is superior to \
other methods.  imeche 2021.

Title: a review of MACHINE_LEARNING STATE_OF_CHARGE and STATE_OF_HEALTH \
estimation algorithms for LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES
Abstract:
```
VEHICLE_ELECTRIFICATION has been proven to be an EFFICIENT_WAY to reduce \
CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS and solve the ENERGY_CRISIS. \
LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES (libs) are considered the \
DOMINANT_ENERGY_STORAGE_MEDIUM for ELECTRIC_VEHICLES (evs) owing to their \
HIGH_ENERGY_DENSITY and LONG_LIFESPAN. to maintain a safe, efficient, and \
stable operating condition for the BATTERY_SYSTEM, we must monitor the \
state of the battery, especially the STATE_OF_CHARGE (soc) and \
STATE_OF_HEALTH (soh). with the development of BIG_DATA, cloud computing, \
and other emerging techniques, data driven MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) \
techniques have attracted attention for their ENORMOUS_POTENTIAL in \
STATE_ESTIMATION for libs. therefore, this PAPER_REVIEWS the four most \
studied types of ML_ALGORITHMS for soc and SOH_ESTIMATION, including \
SHALLOW_NEURAL_NETWORK (nn), DEEP_LEARNING (dl), SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE \
(svm), and GAUSSIAN_PROCESS_REGRESSION (gpr) methods. the \
BASIC_PRINCIPLES and UNIFORM_FLOWCHARTS of DIFFERENT_ML_ALGORITHMS are \
introduced. then, the applications of each ML_ALGORITHM for \
STATE_ESTIMATION within RECENT_YEARS are comprehensively reviewed and \
compared in terms of used datasets, input features, \
HYPERPARAMETER_SELECTION, PERFORMANCE_METRICS, advantages, and \
disadvantages. based on the investigation, this REVIEW_DISCUSSES the \
current challenges and prospects from four aspects, aiming to provide \
some inspiration for developing advanced ML_STATE_ESTIMATION_ALGORITHMS. \

Abstract:
```
REAL_TIME BATTERY_SOX_ESTIMATION including the STATE_OF_CHARGE (soc), \

Title: COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW of BATTERY_STATE_ESTIMATION_STRATEGIES using \
MACHINE_LEARNING for BATTERY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS of \
AIRCRAFT_PROPULSION_BATTERIES
Abstract:
```
the BATTERY_POWERED PROPULSION_SYSTEM is introduced in the literature as \
a SUITABLE_SOLUTION for the co2 emission challenge induced by aviation. \
however, because of design and manufacturing factors, during or after \
abused operational and ENVIRONMENTAL_SITUATIONS, LITHIUM_ION_BATTERY \
(lib) safety, and reliability cannot be guaranteed. thus, an \
EFFECTIVE_BATTERY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM (bms), is an ESSENTIAL_UNIT in the \
ELECTRIC_PROPULSION_SYSTEM (eps) of ELECTRIC_AIRCRAFT. \
BATTERY_STATE_ESTIMATION and prediction are vital to providing required \
SAFETY_STRATEGIES through acquiring BATTERY_DATA such as CURRENT, \
voltage, and temperature. VARIOUS_METHODS of STATE_ESTIMATION are \
practically and technically analyzed and offered in the literature \
including physics based, model based, and data driven approaches. among \
them, the RECENT_METHOD seems to be a NOVEL_SOLUTION to overcome the \
CURRENT_EXPERIMENTAL_DIFFICULTIES and inaccuracies. in a data driven \
method, the battery is considered as a BLACK_BOX while a LARGE_VOLUME of \
data is applied to learn the INTERNAL_DYNAMICS of the battery, using \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) and MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) approaches. \
however, there are still MAJOR_UNCERTAINTIES and hurdles in the \
application and using ai in eps due to DATA_SOURCE_SCARCITY, the \
complexity of computation, and ambiguities in the \
AIRWORTHINESS_CERTIFICATION_PROCESS. in this study, a \
SYSTEMATIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW is performed; 948 papers were selected to be \
analyzed precisely in both qualitative and QUANTITATIVE_APPROACHES to \
provide descriptive, metadata, and BMS_FUNCTION_ANALYSIS_REPORTS. the \
goal of the research is to review BMS_STRATEGIES supported by \
INTELLIGENT_ALGORITHMS to propose APPROPRIATE_SOLUTIONS for \
BATTERY_MANAGEMENT of eps based on the proposed bms NECESSARY_FUNCTIONS. \
moreover, CURRENT_AIRWORTHINESS_CERTIFICATION_REGULATIONS are analyzed, \
and it is shown that the existing status is insufficient to satisfy \
CRITICAL_ISSUES for employing DATA_DRIVEN_METHODS in the \
BATTERY_MANAGEMENT of FUTURE_ELECTRIC_AIRCRAFT including \
AI_SAFETY_RISK_ASSESSMENT and LEARNING_ASSURANCE. finally, trends show an \
increase in studies on the subject of AI_THEMES_APPLICATION in \
BATTERY_STATE_ESTIMATION during the last ten years, especially for the \
state of charge and the state of health. however, there are still gaps in \
research for the application of INTELLIGENT_TECHNOLOGY in state of \
function (sof) and state of power (sop) estimation as one of the most \
IMPERATIVE_FUNCTIONS of the bms in ea, which consists of less than 1 % of \

Title: TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION of lithium ion battery based on \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL
Abstract:
```
ACCURATE_TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION is one of the most CRITICAL_PROBLEMS to \
improve BATTERY_PERFORMANCE, and prevent THERMAL_RUNAWAY. however, the \
HEAT_GENERATION and HEAT_DISSIPATION of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES have \
COMPLEX_NONLINEAR_CHARACTERISTICS and are easily affected by \
EXTERNAL_FACTORS, therefore it is difficult to accurately predict the \
BATTERY_TEMPERATURE. in RECENT_YEARS, ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) has \
been widely used in many fields of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES due to its \
UNIQUE_ADVANTAGES in dealing with highly non linear problems, such as \
battery modeling and SOC_ESTIMATION, RESIDUAL_LIFE (rul) prediction and \
BATTERY_TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION. however, there are few studies on \
TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES in \
FOAM_METAL_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM, and the CURRENT_RESEARCH has not \
reached an ACCURATE_CONCLUSION to explain which NEURAL_NETWORK is better \
for TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION. therefore, an \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_APPROACH was used to estimate the temperature \
change of LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES in the \
METAL_FOAM_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM. back PROPAGATION_NEURAL_NETWORK (bp \
nn), RADIAL_BASIS_FUNCTIONS_NEURAL_NETWORK (rbf nn) and \
ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORKS (elman nn) were respectively applied to establish \
the TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION_MODEL, and the \
TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION_PERFORMANCE of DIFFERENT_NEURAL_NETWORK modeling \
techniques were compared. in order to verify the accuracy and validity of \
the NEURAL_NETWORK_THERMAL_MODEL, the PERFORMANCE_TESTS under the \
SAMPLE_CONDITION and the NEW_CONDITION were carried out respectively. the \
predicted RESULT_DATA and TEMPERATURE_CONTRAST_DIAGRAM of sample and \
TEST_CONDITIONS are obtained. ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL has better \
adaptability and GENERALIZATION_ABILITY, and the training time of \
ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL is shorter. it is more suitable for the \
TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION of libs under METAL_FOAM and forced air cooling \

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING assisted advanced BATTERY_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM: a \
state of the art review
Abstract:
```
with an increasingly wider application of the lithium ion battery (lib), \
specifically the DRASTIC_INCREASE of ELECTRIC_VEHICLES in \
COSMOPOLITAN_CITIES, improving the thermal and FIRE_RESILIENCE of \
LIB_SYSTEMS is inevitable. thus, in depth analysis and performance based \
study on BATTERY_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM (btms) design have arisen as a \
POPULAR_RESEARCH_TOPIC in ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS. among the \
LIB_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS, such as BATTERY_TEMPERATURE_DISTRIBUTION, \
BATTERY_HEAT_GENERATION_RATE, cooling MEDIUM_PROPERTIES, \
ELECTRICAL_PROPERTIES, PHYSICAL_DIMENSION_DESIGN, etc., multi factor \
design optimisation is one of the most DIFFICULT_EXPERIMENTAL_TASKS. \
COMPUTATIONAL_SIMULATIONS deliver a HOLISTIC_SOLUTION to the BTMS_DESIGN, \
yet it demands an immense amount of COMPUTATIONAL_POWER and time, which \
is often not practical for the DESIGN_OPTIMISATION_PROCESS. therefore, \
MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) models play a non substitute role in the \
SAFETY_MANAGEMENT of BATTERY_SYSTEMS. ML_MODELS aid in \
TEMPERATURE_PREDICTION and SAFETY_DIAGNOSIS, thereby assisting in the \
EARLY_WARNING of BATTERY_FIRE and its MITIGATION. in this REVIEW_ARTICLE, \
we summarise extensive lists of literature on btms employing ML_MODELS \
and identify the current state of the art research, which is expected to \
serve as a much needed guideline and reference for \
FUTURE_DESIGN_OPTIMISATION. following that, the application of \
VARIOUS_ML_MODELS in BATTERY_FIRE_DIAGNOSIS and EARLY_WARNING is \

REAL_TIME issues obtained in electric vehicles (evs) due to the various \
ranges of energy storage devices. in general, ev energy management system \
is integrated with power electronic circuits for effective power \
conversion and RELIABLE_OPERATION. some issues are addressed while using \
the batteries in ev systems such as CHARGING time, efficiency of battery, \
and RAW_MATERIALS. not only BATTERY_ISSUES but also REAL_TIME non \
technical issues and operational issues are also discussed in this paper. \
during energy conversion with power electronic circuits, the \
SYSTEM_ATTAINS_EXTREME_TEMPERATURE_LEVELS which in TURN_REDUCES the \
performance of the system. to maintain an optimum TEMPERATURE level, it \
is important to study the TEMPERATURE_EFFECT of the system at the most \
prior levels. due to the adaption of power electronic components, some \
extent of noise is generated, technically treated as electromagnetic \
interference (emi), as SYSTEM_CAPACITY_INCREASES the emi content also \
improved proportionately. therefore, to mitigate the emi effect, the low \
pass filter based emi filter is introduced in the system such that the \
noise level is suppressed. bidirectional CHARGING system (bcs) is one of \
the emerging technologies in ev to obtain AUTONOMOUS_POWER supply systems \
in the form of vehicle to grid (v2g), grid to vehicle (g2v), and vehicle \
to load (v2l). to know the behaviour of bcs the proposed RNN_CONTROLLER \
is employed and is compared with ANN_BIDIRECTIONAL CHARGING model. bcs \
CHARGING system with RNN_CONTROLLER has better dynamic response to \
exchange the power via dc/dc converter and ac/dc converter as compared to \

Abstract:
```
solar is a SIGNIFICANT_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCE. SOLAR_ENERGY can provide \
for the WORLDS_ENERGY_NEEDS while minimizing global warming from \

POWER_SYSTEMS. it is crucial to accurately forecast the output of \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES in order to assure GRID_DEPENDABILITY and \
sustainability and to reduce the risk and expense of ENERGY_MARKETS and \
systems. RECENT_ADVANCEMENTS in LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY (lstm) have \
attracted researchers to the model, and its PROMISING_POTENTIAL is \
reflected in the METHODS_RICHNESS and the growing number of papers about \
it. to facilitate further research and development in this area, this \
PAPER_INVESTIGATES_LSTM_MODELS for forecasting SOLAR_ENERGY by using time \
series data. the paper is divided into two parts: (1) \
INDEPENDENT_LSTM_MODELS and (2) HYBRID_MODELS that INCORPORATE_LSTM as \
another type of technique. the root mean SQUARE_ERROR (rmse) and other \
ERROR_METRICS are used as the REPRESENTATIVE_EVALUATION_METRICS for \
comparing the accuracy of the selected methods. according to \
EMPIRICAL_STUDIES, the two types of models (INDEPENDENT_LSTM and hybrid) \

generally OUTPERFORM_STANDALONE_MODELS despite their longer \

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING based remaining USEFUL_LIFE_PREDICTION_TECHNIQUES for \
lithium ion BATTERY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS: a COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
LITHIUM_ION_BATTERIES (libs) are used to POWER a range of applications \
starting from PORTABLE_CONSUMER_ELECTRONICS to ELECTRIC_VEHICLES and grid \
tied ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS. now, with the increasing application of lib \
in HIGH_POWER and SOPHISTICATED_APPLICATIONS, it is of GREAT_SIGNIFICANCE \
to predict the remaining USEFUL_LIFE (rul) for RELIABLE_OPERATION and to \
protect the BATTERY_PACK from unwanted incidents including \
CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE. real time information on rul is essential to \
predict BATTERY_FAILURE_CONDITION resulting in EFFECTIVE_PREVENTION or at \
least reduction of the damage that may cause by the BATTERY_FAILURE. \
moreover, ACCURATE_RUL is extremely helpful for scheduling \
ROUTINE_MAINTENANCE and NECESSARY_REPLACEMENT at the end of its \
USEFUL_LIFE. consequently, RUL_PREDICTION has become a topic of interest \
to researchers. there are several RUL_ESTIMATION_TECHNIQUES proposed in \
the last decade where MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) based techniques showed \
superiority in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and modeling. therefore, \
ml based RUL_PREDICTION_METHODS are comprehensively reviewed based on \
their ESSENTIAL_PERFORMANCE_PARAMETERS in this paper. a detailed \
discussion on the issues, challenges, trends, and FUTURE_RESEARCH_SCOPES \
are also presented to provide CLEAR_GUIDELINE to the researchers. c 2023 \

Title: CLOUD_BASED ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_FRAMEWORK for \
BATTERY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
Abstract:
```
as the popularity of ELECTRIC_VEHICLES (evs) and SMART_GRIDS continues to \
rise, so does the demand for batteries. within the landscape of \
BATTERY_POWERED ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS, the BATTERY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM \
(bms) is crucial. it provides KEY_FUNCTIONS such as \
BATTERY_STATE_ESTIMATION (including STATE_OF_CHARGE, STATE_OF_HEALTH, \
BATTERY_SAFETY, and THERMAL_MANAGEMENT) as well as cell BALANCING. its \
PRIMARY_ROLE is to ensure SAFE_BATTERY_OPERATION. however, due to the \
limited memory and COMPUTATIONAL_CAPACITY of ONBOARD_CHIPS, achieving \
this goal is challenging, as both theory and PRACTICAL_EVIDENCE suggest. \
given the immense amount of BATTERY_DATA produced over its \
OPERATIONAL_LIFE, the SCIENTIFIC_COMMUNITY is increasingly turning to \
CLOUD computing for DATA_STORAGE and analysis. this CLOUD_BASED \
DIGITAL_SOLUTION presents a more flexible and EFFICIENT_ALTERNATIVE to \
TRADITIONAL_METHODS that often require SIGNIFICANT_HARDWARE_INVESTMENTS. \
the integration of MACHINE_LEARNING is becoming an ESSENTIAL_TOOL for \
extracting patterns and insights from VAST_AMOUNTS of OBSERVATIONAL_DATA. \
as a result, the FUTURE_POINTS towards the development of a CLOUD_BASED \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) enhanced bms. this will notably improve the \
predictive and modeling capacity for long range connections across \
VARIOUS_TIMESCALES, by combining the strength of PHYSICAL_PROCESS_MODELS \
with the versatility of MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES.  2023 by the \

Abstract:
```
lithium ion batteries (libs) have become one of the best solutions to the \
ENERGY_STORAGE_ISSUE in MODERN_SOCIETY. however, the BATTERY_MATERIALS \
and DEVICE_DEVELOPMENT are both complex, and involve \
MULTIVARIABLE_PROBLEMS. traditional trial and error approach, which \
relies on researchers to CONDUCT_EXPERIMENTS, has encountered bottlenecks \
in the improvement of the BATTERY_PERFORMANCE. ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE \
(ai) is the most POTENTIAL_TECHNOLOGY to deal with this issue due to its \
powerful high speed and capabilities of processing MASSIVE_DATA. in \
particular, the capability of MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) algorithms in \
assessing MULTIDIMENSIONAL_DATA_VARIABLES and discovering patterns in the \
sets are expected to assist researchers in discovering patterns and \
elucidating the mechanisms of MATERIAL_SYNTHESIS and DEVICE_FABRICATION. \
this REVIEW_SUMMARIZES various challenges encountered in \
TRADITIONAL_RESEARCH_METHODS of libs and introduces the applications of \
ai in BATTERY_MATERIAL_RESEARCH, BATTERY_DEVICE_DESIGN and manufacturing, \
material and DEVICE_CHARACTERIZATIONS, and BATTERY_CYCLE_LIFE and \
SAFETY_ASSESSMENT in detail. most importantly, we present the challenges \
faced by ai and ml in BATTERY_RESEARCH, and discuss the shortcomings and \
prospects of their applications. we believe that a closer collaboration \
among experimentalists, modeling specialists, and AI_EXPERTS in the \
future will greatly FACILITATE_AI and ML_METHODS for solving battery and \

Title: DEEP_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS for very SHORT_TERM_SOLAR_IRRADIANCE \
FORECASTING: a survey
Abstract:
```
integrating SOLAR_ENERGY with existing GRID_SYSTEMS is difficult due to \
its variability, which is impacted by factors such as the predicted \
horizon, METEOROLOGICAL_CONDITIONS, and GEOGRAPHIC_POSITION. \
ACCURATE_GLOBAL_HORIZONTAL_IRRADIANCE (ghi) estimates can help to address \
this issue and allow for early and EFFECTIVE_PARTICIPATION in the \
ENERGY_PLANNING and MANAGEMENT_MARKET. the existing models either use \
TIME_SERIES_DATA or SKY_IMAGES in VARIOUS_NETWORK_TOPOLOGIES to perform \
SOLAR_RADIANCE_FORECASTS. this STUDY_COMPARES three categories of \
SOLAR_IRRADIANCE_FORECASTING models such as TIME_SERIES based, image \
based and HYBRID_MODELS. here several state of the art methods are \
compared against the proposed models, namely convolutional \
LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY fusion network (cnn l) and \
MULTIPLE_IMAGE_CONVOLUTIONAL LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY fusion network (micnn \
l). both models use both infrared SKY_IMAGES as well as PAST_VALUES of \
ghi for prediction. these METHODS_EXTRACT_SPATIAL features using \
CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS and temporal features using \
LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY networks. the extracted features are finally \
concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer to obtain a \
prediction. further analysis also included using a \
FEATURE_EXTRACTION_METHOD such as OPTICAL_FLOW (of) on the IMAGE_DATA \
before passing it to the HYBRID_MODEL micnn l (of). the results observed \
in this COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS denote that micnn l improves the efficacy of \
the forecasts in CLOUDY_CONDITIONS compared to the rest of the state of \

Title: a review on NEURAL_NETWORK based models for SHORT_TERM_SOLAR_IRRADIANCE \
forecasting
Abstract:
```
the accuracy of SOLAR_ENERGY forecasting is critical for \
POWER_SYSTEM_PLANNING, management, and operation in the \
GLOBAL_ELECTRIC_ENERGY_GRID. therefore, it is crucial to ensure a \
constant and SUSTAINABLE_POWER supply to consumers. however, existing \
statistical and MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS are not reliable for \
forecasting due to the SPORADIC_NATURE of SOLAR_ENERGY_DATA. several \
factors influence the performance of SOLAR_IRRADIANCE, such as \
forecasting horizon, WEATHER_CLASSIFICATION, and \
PERFORMANCE_EVALUATION_METRICS. therefore, we provide a REVIEW_PAPER on \
DEEP_LEARNING based SOLAR_IRRADIANCE_FORECASTING models. these models \
include LONG_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY (ltsm), gated RECURRENT_UNIT (gru), \
RECURRENT_NEURAL_NETWORK (rnn), CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (cnn), \
GENERATIVE_ADVERSARIAL_NETWORKS (gan), ATTENTION_MECHANISM (am), and \
other existing HYBRID_MODELS. based on our analysis, DEEP_LEARNING_MODELS \
perform better than CONVENTIONAL_MODELS in solar forecasting \
applications, especially in combination with some techniques that enhance \
the extraction of features. furthermore, the use of \
DATA_AUGMENTATION_TECHNIQUES to improve DEEP_LEARNING_PERFORMANCE is \
useful, especially for DEEP_NETWORKS. thus, this paper is expected to \
provide a BASELINE_ANALYSIS for FUTURE_RESEARCHERS to select the most \
APPROPRIATE_APPROACHES for PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER forecasting, wind power \

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING_AND_COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY to improve \
BIOCHAR_FERTILIZERS: a review
Abstract:
```
TRADITIONAL_FERTILIZERS are highly inefficient, with a MAJOR_LOSS of \
nutrients and associated pollution. alternatively, biochar loaded with \
phosphorous is a SUSTAINABLE_FERTILIZER that IMPROVES_SOIL_STRUCTURE, \
STORES_CARBON in soils, and provides PLANT_NUTRIENTS in the LONG_RUN, yet \
most biochars are not optimal because \
MECHANISMS_RULING_BIOCHAR_PROPERTIES are poorly known. this issue can be \
solved by RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS in \
MACHINE_LEARNING_AND_COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY. here we review \
PHOSPHORUS_LOADED_BIOCHAR with emphasis on COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY, \
MACHINE_LEARNING, ORGANIC_ACIDS, drawbacks of CLASSICAL_FERTILIZERS, \
BIOCHAR_PRODUCTION, phosphorus loading, and mechanisms of \
PHOSPHOROUS_RELEASE. modeling techniques allow for deciphering the \
influence of INDIVIDUAL_VARIABLES on biochar, employing various \
supervised LEARNING_MODELS tailored to DIFFERENT_BIOCHAR_TYPES. \
COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY provides knowledge on factors that \
CONTROL_PHOSPHORUS binding, e.g., the type of PHOSPHORUS_COMPOUND, \
SOIL_CONSTITUENTS, MINERAL_SURFACES, binding motifs, water, SOLUTION_PH, \
and REDOX_POTENTIAL. PHOSPHORUS_RELEASE from biochar is controlled by \
coexisting anions, ph, ADSORBENT_DOSAGE, \
INITIAL_PHOSPHORUS_CONCENTRATION, and temperature. PYROLYSIS_TEMPERATURES \
below 600 C_ENHANCE FUNCTIONAL_GROUP_RETENTION, while temperatures below \
450 C_INCREASE plant available phosphorus. lower PH_VALUES promote \
PHOSPHORUS_RELEASE, while higher PH_VALUES_HINDER it. \
PHYSICAL_MODIFICATIONS, such as increasing SURFACE_AREA and PORE_VOLUME, \
can maximize the ADSORPTION_CAPACITY of PHOSPHORUS_LOADED_BIOCHAR. \
furthermore, the type of ORGANIC_ACID_AFFECTS_PHOSPHORUS_RELEASE, with \
LOW_MOLECULAR_WEIGHT_ORGANIC_ACIDS being advantageous for \
SOIL_UTILIZATION. lastly, biochar based FERTILIZERS_RELEASE_NUTRIENTS 24 \

Title: PREDICTIVE_DIAGNOSIS with ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK for automated \

Abstract:
```
the requirements and availability of the ELECTRIC_POWERTRAIN will be \
significantly increased with the introduction of AUTOMATED_DRIVING \
functions. in this case, the MECHANICAL_FALLBACK_LEVEL of the driver must \
be replaced by a fault tolerant system. NEW_CONCEPTS such as the \
PREDICTIVE_DIAGNOSTIC or customized OPERATION_STRATEGIES_ENSURE the \
FAULT_TOLERANCE. an ESSENTIAL_COMPONENT to realize the requirements is \
the ELECTRIC_DRIVE. in the PRESENT_WORK, a method for the prediction of \
the FAULT_CONDITION in PERMANENT_MAGNET_SYNCHRONOUS_MOTOR (pmsm) is \
developed based on ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (ann). not only the \
FAILURE_OCCURRENCE is detected, but also the severity of the failure is \
predicted and classified. for this purpose, a SUITABLE_FAILURE_INDICATOR \
is needed, which contradicts the severity of the failure and thus allows \
both the prediction and degradation (protection) of the system. the \
prerequisite for the use of MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS, such as \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS, is the existence of a database. data is \
obtained with the help of SIMULATION_MODEL of pmsm, which can be \
corrected with failures. features from the PHASE_CURRENTS and the battery \
current in the TIME_DOMAIN and in the FREQUENCY_DOMAIN are presented as \
well as CLASSICAL_METHODS such as the WAVELET_ANALYSIS or the \
decomposition into SYMMETRICAL_COMPONENTS. the selection of the features \
has a GREAT_INFLUENCE on the DIAGNOSTIC_RESULT and on the performance of \
the algorithm. the failures are represented by the features in the \
FREQUENCY_DOMAIN. based on these aspects, several NEURAL_NETWORKS are \
formed. to predict the failure, an accuracy of about 95% is achieved and \
for the classification an accuracy of about 98.5%.  2022, the author(s), \
