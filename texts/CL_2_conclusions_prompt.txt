Title: MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNOLOGY in BIODIESEL_RESEARCH: a review
Abstract:
```
BIODIESEL has the potential to significantly contribute to making \
transportation fuels more sustainable. due to the complexity and \
nonlinearity of processes for BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION and use, fast and \
accurate MODELING tools are required for their design, optimization, \
monitoring, and CONTROL. data driven MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) techniques \
have demonstrated SUPERIOR_PREDICTIVE_CAPABILITY compared to \
CONVENTIONAL_METHODS for MODELING such highly COMPLEX_PROCESSES. among \
the AVAILABLE_ML_TECHNIQUES, the ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) \
technology is the most widely used approach in BIODIESEL_RESEARCH. the \
ANN_APPROACH is a COMPUTATIONAL_LEARNING_METHOD that mimics the human \
brain's neurological processing ability to map input output relationships \
of ill defined systems. given its HIGH_GENERALIZATION_CAPACITY, ann has \
gained popularity in dealing with complex nonlinear real world \
engineering and SCIENTIFIC_PROBLEMS. this paper is devoted to thoroughly \
reviewing and critically discussing VARIOUS_ML_TECHNOLOGY_APPLICATIONS, \
with a PARTICULAR_FOCUS on ann, to solve FUNCTION_APPROXIMATION, \
optimization, monitoring, and CONTROL_PROBLEMS in BIODIESEL_RESEARCH. \
moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using ML_TECHNOLOGY in \
BIODIESEL_RESEARCH are highlighted to DIRECT_FUTURE_R&D_EFFORTS in this \
domain. ML_TECHNOLOGY has generally been used in BIODIESEL_RESEARCH for \
MODELING (trans)ESTERIFICATION_PROCESSES, physico chemical \
characteristics of BIODIESEL, and BIODIESEL fueled \
INTERNAL_COMBUSTION_ENGINES. the PRIMARY_PURPOSE of introducing \
ML_TECHNOLOGY to the BIODIESEL_INDUSTRY has been to monitor and \
CONTROL_BIODIESEL_SYSTEMS in real time; however, these issues have rarely \
been explored in the literature. therefore, FUTURE_STUDIES appear to be \
directed towards the use of ML_TECHNIQUES for \
REAL_TIME_PROCESS_MONITORING and CONTROL of BIODIESEL_SYSTEMS to \
ENHANCE_PRODUCTION_EFFICIENCY, ECONOMIC_VIABILITY, and \
ENVIRONMENTAL_SUSTAINABILITY.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

GENERIC_ALGORITHM and RESPONSE_SURFACE_METHODOLOGY in \
MODELING_AND_OPTIMIZATION of BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION_PROCESS_PARAMETERS from \
SHEA_TREE (VITELLARIA_PARADOXA) NUT_BUTTER
Abstract:
```
this work investigated the potential of SHEA_BUTTER_OIL (sbo) as \
feedstock for synthesis of BIODIESEL. due to HIGH_FREE_FATTY_ACID (ffa) \
of sbo used, RESPONSE_SURFACE_METHODOLOGY (rsm) was employed to model and \
optimize the PRETREATMENT_STEP while its conversion to BIODIESEL was \
modeled and optimized using rsm and ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann). the \
ACID_VALUE of the sbo was reduced to 1.19mg koh/g with oil/methanol \
MOLAR_RATIO of 3.3, h2so4 of 0.15 v/v, time of 60min and temperature of \
45c. OPTIMUM_VALUES predicted for the TRANSESTERIFICATION_REACTION by rsm \
were temperature of 90c, koh of 0.6w/v, oil/methanol MOLAR_RATIO of 3.5, \
and time of 30min with ACTUAL_SHEA_BUTTER_OIL_BIODIESEL (sbob) yield of \
99.65% (w/w). ann combined with GENERIC_ALGORITHM gave the \
OPTIMAL_CONDITION as temperature of 82c, koh of 0.40w/v, oil/methanol \
MOLAR_RATIO of 2.62 and time of 30min with ACTUAL_SBOB_YIELD of 99.94% \

HEAT_TRANSFER in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEM
Abstract:
```
NANOFLUIDS have gained SIGNIFICANT_POPULARITY in the field of sustainable \
and RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS. the HEAT_TRANSFER capacity of the \
WORKING_FLUID has a HUGE_IMPACT on the efficiency of the \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEM. the addition of a SMALL_AMOUNT of \
HIGH_THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY SOLID_NANOPARTICLES to a \
BASE_FLUID_IMPROVES_HEAT transfer. even though a LARGE_AMOUNT of \
RESEARCH_DATA is available in the literature, some results are \
contradictory. many influencing factors, as well as nonlinearity and \
refutations, make NANOFLUID_RESEARCH highly challenging and obstruct its \
potentially VALUABLE_USES. on the other hand, data driven \
MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES would be very useful in NANOFLUID_RESEARCH \
for forecasting thermophysical features and HEAT_TRANSFER rate, \
identifying the most INFLUENTIAL_FACTORS, and assessing the efficiencies \
of DIFFERENT_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS. the PRIMARY_AIM of this \
REVIEW_STUDY is to look at the features and applications of \
DIFFERENT_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES employed in the nanofluid based \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEM, as well as to reveal NEW_DEVELOPMENTS in \
MACHINE_LEARNING_RESEARCH. a variety of \
MODERN_MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS for nanofluid based HEAT_TRANSFER \
studies in renewable and SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS are examined, along \
with their advantages and disadvantages. ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL networks based \
MODEL_PREDICTION using CONTEMPORARY_COMMERCIAL_SOFTWARE is simple to \
develop and the most popular. the PROGNOSTIC_CAPACITY may be further \
improved by combining a MARINE_PREDATOR_ALGORITHM, GENETIC_ALGORITHM, \
SWARM_INTELLIGENCE_OPTIMIZATION, and other \
INTELLIGENT_OPTIMIZATION_APPROACHES. in addition to the well known \
NEURAL_NETWORKS and fuzzy  and gene based MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES, \
newer ENSEMBLE_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES such as boosted \
REGRESSION_TECHNIQUES, k means, k nearest neighbor (knn), catboost, and \
xgboost are gaining popularity due to their improved architectures and \
adaptabilities to DIVERSE_DATA_TYPES. the regularly used NEURAL_NETWORKS \
and fuzzy based algorithms are mostly black box methods, with the user \
having little or no understanding of how they function. this is the \
reason for concern, and ETHICAL_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE is required. \

Title: development of a BAYESIAN_NETWORK_MODEL for OPTIMAL_SITE_SELECTION of \
ELECTRIC_VEHICLE_CHARGING station
Abstract:
```
fast CHARGING sites play a CRUCIAL_ROLE for PUBLIC_ACCEPTANCE of \
ELECTRIC_VEHICLE (ev). selection of the most SUSTAINABLE_SITE positively \

Abstract:
```
over the past two decades, the use of MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) methods to \
MODEL_BIOMASS and WASTE_GASIFICATION/PYROLYSIS has increased rapidly. \
only 70 papers were published in the 2000s compared to a total of 549 \
publications in the 2010s. however, the approaches and findings have yet \
to be systematically reviewed. in this work, the MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS \
most commonly employed for modelling GASIFICATION and PYROLYSIS_PROCESSES \
are discussed with reference to their applications, merits, and \
limitations. WHILST_COEFFICIENTS of determination (r2) can be difficult \
to compare directly, due to some studies having greatly \
DIFFERENT_APPROACHES and aims, most studies consistently achieved a \
HIGH_PREDICTION_ACCURACY with r2 > 0.90. ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS have \
been most widely used due to their potential to learn highly NON_LINEAR \
input output relationships. however, a variety of methods (e.g. \
REGRESSION_METHODS, tree based methods, and SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES) are \
appropriate depending on the application, DATA_AVAILABILITY, MODEL_SPEED, \
etc. it is concluded that ml has GREAT_POTENTIAL for the development of \
models with greater accuracy. some advantages of MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS \
over existing models are their ability to incorporate relevant non \
numerical parameters and the power to generate a multitude of solutions \
for a WIDE_RANGE of INPUT_PARAMETERS. more emphasis should be placed on \
MODEL_INTERPRETABILITY in order to better understand the processes being \
studied.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: PROSPECTIVE_METHODOLOGIES in hybrid RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SYSTEMS for energy \
PREDICTION using artificial NEURAL_NETWORKS
Abstract:
```
this paper presents a comprehensive review of MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) based \
approaches, especially artificial NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns) in \
TIME_SERIES_DATA_PREDICTION_PROBLEMS. according to literature, around 80% \
of the WORLDS_TOTAL_ENERGY_DEMAND is supplied either through fuel based \
sources such as oil, gas, and coal or through nuclear based sources. \
literature also shows that a shortage of fossil fuels is inevitable and \
the world will face this problem sooner or later. moreover, the remote \
and RURAL_AREAS that suffer from not being able to reach \
TRADITIONAL_GRID_POWER_ELECTRICITY_NEED ALTERNATIVE_SOURCES of energy. a \
hybrid RENEWABLE_ENERGY system (hres) involving different renewable \
resources can be used to supply SUSTAINABLE_POWER in these areas. the \
UNCERTAIN_NATURE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES and the \
INTELLIGENT_ABILITY of the NEURAL_NETWORK_APPROACH to process complex \
time series inputs have inspired the use of ANN_METHODS in \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY forecasting. thus, this STUDY_AIMS to study the \
different data driven models of ANN_APPROACHES that can provide \
ACCURATE_PREDICTIONS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY, like solar, wind, or hydro \
power generation. VARIOUS_REFINEMENT_ARCHITECTURES of NEURAL_NETWORKS, \
such as multi layer perception (mlp), recurrent neural network (rnn), and \
convolutional neural network (cnn), as well as long short term memory \
(lstm) models, have been offered in the applications of RENEWABLE_ENERGY \
forecasting. these models are able to perform short term time series \
PREDICTION in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES and to use prior information that \
influences its value in future PREDICTION.  2021 by the authors. \

Title: applications of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE based MODELING for \
BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS: a review
Abstract:
```
BIOENERGY is widely considered a SUSTAINABLE_ALTERNATIVE to FOSSIL_FUELS. \
however, LARGE_SCALE_APPLICATIONS of BIOMASS based ENERGY_PRODUCTS are \
limited due to challenges related to FEEDSTOCK_VARIABILITY, \
CONVERSION_ECONOMICS, and SUPPLY_CHAIN_RELIABILITY. \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai), an emerging concept, has been applied to \
BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS in RECENT_DECADES to address those challenges. this \
paper reviewed 164 articles published between 2005 and 2019 that applied \
DIFFERENT_AI_TECHNIQUES to BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS. this REVIEW_FOCUSES on \
identifying the UNIQUE_CAPABILITIES of VARIOUS_AI_TECHNIQUES in \
addressing BIOENERGY related research challenges and improving the \
performance of BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS. specifically, we characterized \
AI_STUDIES by their INPUT_VARIABLES, OUTPUT_VARIABLES, AI_TECHNIQUES, \
DATASET_SIZE, and performance. we examined AI_APPLICATIONS throughout the \
LIFE_CYCLE of BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS. we identified four areas in which ai has \
been mostly applied, including (1) the prediction of BIOMASS_PROPERTIES, \
(2) the prediction of PROCESS_PERFORMANCE of BIOMASS_CONVERSION, \
including DIFFERENT_CONVERSION_PATHWAYS and technologies, (3) the \
prediction of BIOFUEL_PROPERTIES and the performance of BIOENERGY end use \
systems, and (4) SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODELING and optimization. based on the \
review, ai is particularly useful in generating data that are hard to be \
measured directly, improving TRADITIONAL_MODELS of BIOMASS_CONVERSION and \
BIOFUEL end uses, and overcoming the challenges of TRADITIONAL_COMPUTING \
techniques for BIOENERGY SUPPLY_CHAIN design and optimization. for \
FUTURE_RESEARCH, efforts are needed to develop standardized and \
PRACTICAL_PROCEDURES for selecting AI_TECHNIQUES and determining \
TRAINING_DATA_SAMPLES, to ENHANCE_DATA_COLLECTION, documentation, and \
sharing across BIOENERGY related areas, and to explore the potential of \
ai in supporting the SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS from \
HOLISTIC_PERSPECTIVES.  2021 the authors. GCB_BIOENERGY published by \

Title: MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS for modeling conventional and \
HYDROTHERMAL_GASIFICATION of WASTE_BIOMASS: a REVIEW
Abstract:
```
conventional and HYDROTHERMAL_GASIFICATION are \
PROMISING_THERMOCHEMICAL_TECHNOLOGIES for the production of syngas from \
WASTE_BIOMASS. both GASIFICATION_PROCESSES are complex, with several \
INTERMEDIATE_REACTIONS occurring simultaneously and at DIFFERENT_TIMES. \
therefore, traditional modeling approaches, including thermodynamic and \
KINETIC_MODELS, process modeling and COMPUTATION_FLUID_DYNAMICS (cfd), \
are sometimes used to describe the process and study the influence of \
PROCESS_PARAMETERS on SYNGAS_YIELD. however, most TRADITIONAL_MODELS are \
impractical and often challenging to model the input output relationship. \
MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) methods provide a PROMISING_ALTERNATIVE to \
traditional modeling approaches. this study outlined the advancement in \
the application of ml to GASIFICATION_RESEARCH. DIFFERENT_ML_ALGORITHMS, \
including ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS, DEEP_LEARNING and \
SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES, are briefly described. challenges and \
limitations of ml based methods for GASIFICATION_RESEARCH are also \
discussed. when implemented effectively, ml  approaches could foster the \
development of NOVEL_HETEROGENEOUS_CATALYSTS for BIOMASS_GASIFICATION. \

Title: metaheuristic algorithms applied to bioenergy SUPPLY_CHAIN problems: \
theory, review, challenges, and future
Abstract:
```
bioenergy is a new source of energy that accounts for a \
SUBSTANTIAL_PORTION of the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION in many countries. \
the production of bioenergy is expected to increase due to its \
UNIQUE_ADVANTAGES, such as no harmful emissions and abundance. supply \
related problems are the main obstacles precluding the increase of use of \
biomass (which is bulky and has low energy density) to produce bioenergy. \
to overcome this challenge, large scale optimization models are needed to \
be solved to enable decision makers to plan, design, and manage bioenergy \
SUPPLY_CHAINS. therefore, the use of effective optimization approaches is \
of great importance. the TRADITIONAL_MATHEMATICAL_METHODS (such as \
linear, integer, and mixed integer programming) frequently fail to find \
optimal solutions for non convex and/or large scale models whereas \
metaheuristics are efficient approaches for finding near optimal \
solutions that use less computational resources. this paper presents a \
comprehensive review by studying and analyzing the application of \
metaheuristics to solve bioenergy SUPPLY_CHAIN models as well as the \
exclusive challenges of the mathematical problems applied in the \
bioenergy SUPPLY_CHAIN field. the reviewed metaheuristics include: (1) \
POPULATION_APPROACHES, such as ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION (aco), the genetic \
algorithm (ga), particle swarm optimization (pso), and bee colony \
algorithm (bca); and (2) TRAJECTORY_APPROACHES, such as the TABU_SEARCH \
(ts) and SIMULATED_ANNEALING (sa). based on the outcomes of this \
literature review, the integrated design and planning of bioenergy \
SUPPLY_CHAINS problem has been solved primarily by implementing the ga. \
the PRODUCTION_PROCESS_OPTIMIZATION was addressed primarily by using both \
the ga and pso. the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK_DESIGN_PROBLEM was treated by \
utilizing the ga and aco. the truck and TASK_SCHEDULING_PROBLEM was \
solved using the sa and the ts, where the trajectory based methods proved \
to outperform the population based methods.  2014 by the authors; \

Title: ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_APPLICATION in a RENEWABLE_ENERGY driven \
DESALINATION_SYSTEM: a CRITICAL_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE, an emerging technology, widely exists in the \
field of ENGINEERING_SCIENCE and technology. due to its HIGH_EFFICIENCY \
and precision, ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE is increasingly used in the \
OPTIMAL_CONTROL of WATER_TREATMENT and SEAWATER_DESALINATION. generally, \
the design of a DESALINATION_SYSTEM includes four processes: \
SITE_SELECTION, ENERGY_PREDICTION, DESALINATION_TECHNOLOGY_SELECTION and \
SYSTEMATIC_PARAMETER_OPTIMIZATION. to a LARGE_EXTENT, these choices \
depend on the experience and RELEVANT_CRITERIA of researchers and \
experts. however, facing the scientific and TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and \
growing expectations, it is impossible to solve \
SUCH_COMPLEX_NONLINEAR_PROBLEMS by SIMPLE_EXPERIENCE and \
MATHEMATICAL_MODELS, but ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE is good at this. in this \
paper, we synthetically analyzed and summarized the application of \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in the field of SEAWATER_DESALINATION with \
RENEWABLE_ENERGY. ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_APPLICATION in DESALINATION is \
mainly divided into four aspects: expert DECISION_MAKING, optimization, \
PREDICTION_AND_CONTROL by sequence. the features of \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE employed in the design of DESALINATION_SYSTEMS \
not only realize the maximum of efficiency and minimum of cost, but \
release the HUMAN_RESOURCES. after analyzing the four processes of \
DESALINATION, it is found that ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK and \
GENETIC_ALGORITHM are more widespread and mature than other ALGORITHMS in \
dealing with multi objective NONLINEAR_PROBLEMS. this paper overviewed \
the application of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNOLOGIES in \
DECISION_MAKING, optimization, PREDICTION_AND_CONTROL throughout the four \
processes of DESALINATION_DESIGNS. finally, the application and \
FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT_PROSPECT of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in the field of \
SEAWATER_DESALINATION are summarized.  2021

Title: performance prediction, OPTIMAL_DESIGN and OPERATIONAL_CONTROL of \
THERMAL_ENERGY_STORAGE using ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_METHODS
Abstract:
```
capable of storing and redistributing energy, THERMAL_ENERGY_STORAGE \
(tes) shows a promising applicability in ENERGY_SYSTEMS. recently, \
ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) technique is gradually playing an \
IMPORTANT_ROLE in automation, INFORMATION_RETRIEVAL, DECISION_MAKING, \
INTELLIGENT_RECOGNITION, monitoring and management. with the assistance \
of AI_TECHNIQUES, TES_SYSTEMS can become more and more reasonable and \
intelligent, which paves a NEW_PATH for the researches on tes. in the \
present review, a COMPREHENSIVE_LITERATURE_SUMMARIZATION and analysis on \
the application of AI_TECHNIQUES to tes is presented. performance \
prediction, OPTIMAL_DESIGN, control and operation by means of ai for the \
TES_SYSTEMS with VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS are discussed and compared. this \
review shows that ai based prediction models, like \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK and SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE, can accurately \
estimate the TES_PERFORMANCE and the properties of TES_MATERIALS in a \
very fast fashion. ai based OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS, such as \
GENETIC_ALGORITHM, PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION, and teaching learning \
based optimization are able to optimize the design and operation of the \
TES_SYSTEMS towards the objectives like higher SYSTEM_EFFICIENCY, \
COST_SAVINGS, more renewable ENERGY_UTILIZATION and less \
ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS. FUZZY_LOGIC can be utilized to properly \
DESIGN_AND_CONTROL the TES_SYSTEMS where uncertain and IMPRECISE_FACTORS \
are inevitably present. GENERAL_STRATEGIES of the ai based \
TES_PERFORMANCE modelling and the completely ai based DESIGN_AND_CONTROL \
of the tes are summarized, while the MAIN_LIMITATIONS are that ai cannot \
be used to directly unveil the UNKNOWN_PHYSICAL_MECHANISM of the tes and \
that the lack of the COMPREHENSIVE_TES_PERFORMANCE_DATABASE_HINDERS the \
real world implementation. on the way to completely \
INTELLIGENT_TES_SYSTEMS, further investigations on the enhancement of \
adaptation and self improvement capability are necessary. in addition, \
the potential research topics are pointed out for the FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT \
and deployment referring to the needs of the FUTURE_SMART_ENERGY_SYSTEM, \
intelligent and ZERO_ENERGY_BUILDING, and smart home.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: integration of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE into BIOGAS_PLANT_OPERATION
Abstract:
```
in the BIOGAS_PLANTS, ORGANIC_MATERIAL is converted to biogas under \
ANAEROBIC_CONDITIONS through physical and BIOCHEMICAL_PROCESSES. from \
supply of the RAW_MATERIAL to the arrival of the products to customers, \
there are SERIAL_PROCESSES which should be sufficiently monitored for \
optimizing the efficiency of the WHOLE_PROCESS. in particular, the \
ANAEROBIC_DIGESTION_PROCESS, which consists of sequential \
COMPLEX_BIOLOGICAL_REACTIONS, requires improved monitoring to prevent \
inhibition. conventional implemented methods at the BIOGAS_PLANTS are not \
adequate for monitoring the OPERATIONAL_PARAMETERS and finding the \
correlation between them. as ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE has been integrated \
in DIFFERENT_AREAS of life, the integration of it into the \
BIOGAS_PRODUCTION_PROCESS will be inevitable for the future of the \
BIOGAS_PLANT_OPERATION. this REVIEW_PAPER first examines the need for \
monitoring at the BIOGAS_PLANTS with giving details about the process and \
PROCESS_MONITORING as well. in the following sections, the \
CURRENT_SITUATION of implementations of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in the \
BIOGAS_PLANT_OPERATION and in the SIMILAR_INDUSTRIES will be represented. \
moreover, considering that all the information gathered from literature \

SUSTAINABLE_POTENTIAL of SOLID_BIOMASS (the so called STANDARD_POTENTIAL) \
for ENERGY_PURPOSES can be significantly increased in the SHORT_RUN when \
breaking some constraints assumed for BIOMASS growing, collection and \
utilization. evaluation of BIOMASS_POTENTIAL (both standard and \
additional) is based on a developed methodology using detailed spatial \
and EMPIRICAL_DATA (GIS). potential is determined for the defined area \
using a bottom up approach where these yields are derived in relation to \
climate and SOIL_CONDITIONS of each LAND_PLOT of agricultural and \

BIOMASS_POTENTIAL from agriculture and FOREST_LAND can be significantly \
increased in the SHORT_RUN (typically from 18% up to 40% in our \

Title: hydrochars as emerging BIOFUELS: RECENT_ADVANCES and application of \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS for the prediction of heating values
Abstract:
```
in this study, the growing SCIENTIFIC_FIELD of ALTERNATIVE_BIOFUELS was \
examined, with respect to hydrochars produced from RENEWABLE_BIOMASSES. \
hydrochars are the SOLID_PRODUCTS of HYDROTHERMAL_CARBONIZATION (htc) and \
their properties depend on the INITIAL_BIOMASS and the temperature and \
duration of treatment. the basic (scopus) and advanced (CITESPACE) \
analysis of literature showed that this is a DYNAMIC_RESEARCH_AREA, with \
several sub fields of INTENSE_ACTIVITY. the focus of researchers on \
SEWAGE_SLUDGE and FOOD_WASTE as HYDROCHAR_PRECURSORS was highlighted and \
reviewed. it was established that hydrochars have improved behavior as \
fuels compared to these FEEDSTOCKS. FOOD_WASTE can be particularly useful \
in co HYDROTHERMAL_CARBONIZATION with ash rich materials. in the case of \
SEWAGE_SLUDGE, SIMULTANEOUS_P_RECOVERY from the HTC_WASTEWATER may add \
more value to the process. for both FEEDSTOCKS, results from large scale \
htc are practically non existent. following the review, related data from \
the years 2014 2020 were retrieved and fitted into four \
DIFFERENT_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns). based on the \
ELEMENTAL_CONTENT, HTC_TEMPERATURE and time (as inputs), the higher \
heating values (hhvs) and yields (as outputs) could be successfully \
predicted, regardless of ORIGINAL_BIOMASS used for HYDROCHAR_PRODUCTION. \
ann3 (based on c, o, H_CONTENT, and HTC_TEMPERATURE) showed the \
OPTIMUM_HHV predicting performance (r2 0.917, root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR \
1.124), however, hydrochars' hhvs could also be satisfactorily predicted \
by the C_CONTENT alone (ann1, r2 0.897, root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR 1.289). \

Title: a review of enhancement of BIOHYDROGEN_PRODUCTIONS by CHEMICAL_ADDITION \
using a supervised MACHINE_LEARNING_METHOD
Abstract:
```
in this work, the impact of CHEMICAL_ADDITIONS, especially NANOPARTICLES \
(nps), was quan titatively analyzed using our constructed \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns)RESPONSE_SURFACE_METHODOLOGY (rsm) \
algorithm. febased and nibased nps and IONS, including mg2+, cu2+, na+, \
nh4+, and k+, behave differently towards the response of HYDROGEN_YIELD \
(hy) and HYDROGEN_EVOLUTION_RATE (her). manipulating the size and \
concentration of nps was found to be effective in enhancing the hy for \
febased nps and IONS, but not for nibased nps and IONS. an OPTIMAL_RANGE \
of PARTICLE_SIZE (86120 nm) and niion/np concentration (81120 mg l1) \
existed for her. meanwhile, the manipulation of the size and \
concentration of nps was found to be ineffective for both iron and nickel \
for the improvement of her. in fact, the variation in size of nps for the \
enhancement of hy and her demonstrated an APPRECIABLE_DIFFERENCE. the \
smaller (less than 42 nm) nps were found to definitely improve the hy, \
whereas for the her, the relatively bigger size of nps (4050 nm) seemed \
to significantly increase the h2 evolution rate. it was also found that \
the variations in the concentration of the investigated IONS only \
statistically influenced the her, not the hy. the level of response (the \
enhanced her) towards inputs was underpinned and the order of \
significance towards her was identified as the following: na+ > mg2+ > \
cu2+ > nh4+ > k+.  2021 by the authors. LICENSEE_MDPI, basel, \

Title: a CRITICAL_REVIEW on ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE for FUEL_CELL_DIAGNOSIS
Abstract:
```
in RECENT_YEARS, FUEL_CELL (fc) technology has seen a PROMISING_INCREASE \
in its proportion in STATIONARY_POWER_PRODUCTION. several PILOT_PROJECTS \
are in operation across the world, with the number of running hours \
steadily rising, either as stand alone units or as part of integrated \
GAS_TURBINEELECTRIC_ENERGY_PLANTS. fcs are a POTENTIAL_ENERGY_SOURCE with \
GREAT_EFFICIENCY and ZERO_EMISSIONS. to ensure the best performance, they \
normally function within a confined temperature and HUMIDITY_RANGE; \
nevertheless, this makes the system difficult to regulate, resulting in \
defects and hastened deterioration. for diagnosis, there are two \
PRIMARY_APPROACHES: restricted INPUT_INFORMATION, which gives an \
unobtrusive, rapid yet restricted examination, and advanced \
characterization, which provides a more ACCURATE_DIAGNOSIS but frequently \
NECESSITATES_INVASIVE or delayed tests. ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) \
algorithms have shown considerable promise in providing \
ACCURATE_DIAGNOSES with QUICK_DATA collecting. this WORK_FOCUSES on \
SOFTWARE_MODELS that allow the user to evaluate many \
DIFFERENT_POSSIBILITIES in the shortest amount of time and is a \
VITAL_METHOD for proper and DYNAMIC_ANALYSIS of SUCH_ENTITIES. the \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK, GENETIC_ALGORITHM, \
PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION, RANDOM_FOREST, SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE, and \
EXTREME_LEARNING_MACHINE are COMMON_AI_APPROACHES discussed in this \
review. this ARTICLE_EXAMINES the MODERN_PRACTICE and provides \
recommendations for FUTURE_MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODOLOGIES in \
FUEL_CELL_DIAGNOSTIC_APPLICATIONS. in this study, these six AI_TOOLS are \
specifically explained with results for a better understanding of the \
FUEL_CELL_DIAGNOSIS. the CONCLUSION_SUGGESTS that these approaches are \
not only a popular and BENEFICIAL_TOOL for simulating the nature of an \
FC_SYSTEM, but they are also appropriate for optimizing the \
OPERATIONAL_PARAMETERS necessary for an IDEAL_FC_DEVICE. finally, \
observations and ideas for FUTURE_RESEARCH, enhancements, and \

HEALTH_HAZARDS, and degradation of NATURAL_RESOURCES. therefore, the \
quest for eco friendly ENERGY has made researchers to investigate on \
ALTERNATIVE_ENERGY, such as BIOGAS. this REVIEW_STUDY presents a \
COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS of VARIOUS_BIOMASS used for BIOGAS_PRODUCTION \
considering the effects that co DIGESTION of these materials has on \
BIOGAS_YIELD, as well as the technology involved. it further evaluated \
the applicability of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE for modeling and \
optimization of the ANAEROBIC_DIGESTION_PROCESS including the \
BLEND_RATIOS, PROCESS_PARAMETERS and so on. these indices determine the \
PERCENTAGE_METHANE_YIELD from biomaterial. the REVIEW_EFFORT revealed \
that METHANE_CONTENT of biomaterials digested without pre treatment \
varies from 3.6  0.7 to 443.55  13.68 (formula presented.) while the \
YIELD from biomaterials pre treated using VARIOUS_METHODS_VARIES from \
301.38 ml (formula presented.) /g (formula presented.) to 0.735.87 \
l/week. ANAEROBIC_DIGESTION of the blends of COW_DUNG, MANGO_PULP, and \
CHROMOLAENA_ODORATA was reportedly necessary, as information is scantily \
available on it. the modeling of the resulting EXPERIMENTAL_DATA using \
DIFFERENT_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES such as an adaptive neuro \
FUZZY_INFERENCE system and anfis for predicting BIOGAS_YIELD is a \
MAJOR_INFORMATION gathered in this study. the AI_MODELS reviewed have \
HIGH_CORRELATION_FACTORS ranging from 0.8700 to 0.9998. this information \

many countries have adopted NATIONAL_POLICIES to decrease pollution by \
reducing FOSSIL_FUEL_USE and increasing RENEWABLE_ENERGY_USAGE by \
alleviating climate change (wind and solar, etc.). the ever growing need \
for RENEWABLE_SOURCES has led to economic and TECHNOLOGICAL_PROBLEMS, \

the FLOW_RATE varied from 1 to 4 l/min. the effect of \
RADIATION_HEAT_FLUX, MASS_FLOW_RATE, ambient and INLET_TEMPERATURE on the \
THERMAL_EFFICIENCY was analysed. the predicted results of the three above \

FEEDSTOCK_VARIABILITY from biowaste, CONVERSION_COSTS and supply \
CHAIN_STABILITY prevent the WIDESPREAD_USAGE of BIOENERGY_PRODUCTS. \
BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION and VALORIZATION have used ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE \
(ai), a newly developed idea, to overcome these difficulties. this report \
analyzed 118 works that applied VARIOUS_AI_ALGORITHMS to \
BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION and VALORIZATION related research published between \
2007 and 2022. four COMMON_AI_TYPES are utilized in BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION \
and VALORIZATION: NEURAL_NETWORKS, BAYESIAN_NETWORKS, DECISION_TREE, and \
MULTIVARIATE_REGRESSION. the NEURAL_NETWORK is the most FREQUENT_AI for \
PREDICTION_MODELS, the BAYESIAN_NETWORK is utilized for \
PROBABILISTIC_GRAPHICAL_MODELS, and the DECISION_TREE is trusted for \
providing tools to assist DECISION_MAKING. meanwhile, \
MULTIVARIATE_REGRESSION is employed to identify the relationship between \
EXPERIMENTAL_VARIABLES. ai is a remarkably EFFECTIVE_TOOL in predicting \
data, which is reportedly better than the CONVENTIONAL_APPROACH owing to \
its characteristics of time saving and HIGH_ACCURACY. the challenge and \
FUTURE_WORK in BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION and VALORIZATION are briefly \
discussed to maximize the model's performance.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: SYNTHESIS_OPTIMIZATION and ADSORPTION modeling of BIOCHAR for \
POLLUTANT_REMOVAL via MACHINE_LEARNING
Abstract:
```
due to LARGE_SPECIFIC_SURFACE_AREA, abundant FUNCTIONAL_GROUPS and \
LOW_COST, BIOCHAR is widely used for POLLUTANT_REMOVAL. the \
ADSORPTION_PERFORMANCE of BIOCHAR is related to BIOCHAR_SYNTHESIS and \
ADSORPTION_PARAMETERS. but the influence factor is numerous, the \
TRADITIONAL_EXPERIMENTAL_ENUMERATION is powerless. in RECENT_YEARS, \
MACHINE_LEARNING has been gradually employed for BIOCHAR, but there is no \
COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW on the WHOLE_PROCESS_REGULATION of \
BIOCHAR_ADSORBENTS, covering SYNTHESIS_OPTIMIZATION and ADSORPTION \
modeling. this REVIEW_ARTICLE systematically summarized the application \
of MACHINE_LEARNING in BIOCHAR_ADSORBENTS from the perspective of all \
round regulation for the first time, including the SYNTHESIS_OPTIMIZATION \
and ADSORPTION modeling of BIOCHAR_ADSORBENTS. firstly, the overview of \
MACHINE_LEARNING was introduced. then, the latest advances of \
MACHINE_LEARNING in BIOCHAR_SYNTHESIS for POLLUTANT_REMOVAL were \
summarized, including prediction of BIOCHAR_YIELD and \
PHYSICOCHEMICAL_PROPERTIES, OPTIMAL_SYNTHETIC_CONDITIONS and \
ECONOMIC_COST. and the application of MACHINE_LEARNING in \
POLLUTANT_ADSORPTION by BIOCHAR was reviewed, covering prediction of \
ADSORPTION_EFFICIENCY, optimization of EXPERIMENTAL_CONDITIONS and \
revelation of ADSORPTION_MECHANISM. GENERAL_GUIDELINES for the \
application of MACHINE_LEARNING in whole process optimization of BIOCHAR \
from synthesis to ADSORPTION were presented. finally, the existing \
problems and FUTURE_PERSPECTIVES of MACHINE_LEARNING for \
BIOCHAR_ADSORBENTS were put forward. we hope that this review can promote \
the integration of MACHINE_LEARNING and BIOCHAR, and thus light up the \
industrialization of BIOCHAR. GRAPHICAL_ABSTRACT: [figure not available: \

Title: methods, DATA_SOURCES and applications of the ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in \
the ENERGY_POVERTY_CONTEXT: a review
Abstract:
```
ENERGY_POVERTY (ep) is a WIDESPREAD_PROBLEM in europe. EP_DETECTION is \
hampered by a lack of data and GLOBAL_METRICS. recently, \
INNOVATIVE_APPROACHES using ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENT (ai) techniques have \
been increasingly applied for the EP_ALLEVIATION. in this work, studies \
focused on the application of ai on ep were studied. it was identified \
that there is not a HIGH_NUMBER of works that apply ai to fight against \
ep (considering this problem as a MULTIDIMENSIONAL_PHENOMENON). \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL networks based algorithms and DECISION_TREES were the \
most used algorithms in the reviewed literature focused on \
EP_ALLEVIATION. however, several AI_APPLICATIONS focused on \
PARTIAL_ASPECTS of the ep or on areas intimately related to ep (low \
income, high ENERGY_PRICE and low ENERGY_EFFICIENCY of buildings) that \
allow the characterization of the problem in an EFFICIENT_WAY have been \
published in RECENT_YEARS; the last 7 years published literature have \
been reviewed in this work. it was found that NEURAL_NETWORKS_ALGORITHMS \
were the most used models for low income, ENERGY_PRICE and \
POOR_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_CHARACTERIZATIONS. SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES based \
algorithms were the most POPULAR_AI_METHOD applied on ENERGY_CONSUMPTION \
related problems. DEEP_LEARNING was the most POPULAR_TECHNIQUE for \
detecting ENERGY_BILLING_IRREGULARITIES and UNPAID_ENERGY_BILLS.  2022 \

its cost effectiveness and FEEDSTOCK_FLEXIBILITY, with PYROLYSIS being a \
particularly NOTEWORTHY_METHOD for its DIVERSE_PRODUCT_RANGE. despite the \
potential of PYROLYSIS, commercialization remains elusive, and there is a \
growing need to fully understand its dynamics to FACILITATE_PROCESS \
scaling up. however, WASTE_BIOMASS_PYROLYSIS is complex, time consuming, \
and capital intensive. MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) has emerged as a \
POSSIBLE_MEANS of supporting and accelerating PYROLYSIS_RESEARCH despite \
these challenges. this study provides a COMPREHENSIVE_OVERVIEW of the use \
of ml in PYROLYSIS, from biorefinery to end of life product management. \
in addition, the success of ml in PROCESS_OPTIMIZATION and control, \
predicting PRODUCT_YIELD, real time monitoring, LIFE_CYCLE_ASSESSMENT \
(lca), and TECHNO_ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS (tea) during BIOMASS_PYROLYSIS is \
highlighted. several ML_METHODS have been utilized in a bid to study \
PYROLYSIS; the potentiality of ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns) to learn \
extremely non linear input output correlations has led to the \
WIDESPREAD_ADOPTION of these networks. furthermore, the \
CURRENT_KNOWLEDGE_GAPS in ML_RESEARCH in PYROLYSIS and \

Title: AGRICULTURAL_BIOMASS_WASTE to BIOCHAR: a review on BIOCHAR_APPLICATIONS \
using MACHINE_LEARNING_APPROACH and CIRCULAR_ECONOMY
Abstract:
```
BIOCHAR has gained attention as an ALTERNATIVE_SOURCE of SOLID_ENERGY and \
for the PROPER_DISPOSAL of AGRICULTURAL_BIOMASS_WASTE (abw). microwave \
assisted pyrolysis (map) is a PROMISING_APPROACH for the production of \
BIOCHAR. this REVIEW_ARTICLE presents the BENEFICIAL_USE of BIOCHAR for \
SOIL_FERTILIZATION, MACHINE_LEARNING (ml), the CIRCULAR_BIOECONOMY, and \
the TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_LEVEL. the use of MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES \
helps to design, predict, and optimize the process. it can also improve \
the accuracy and efficacy of the BIOCHAR_PRODUCTION_PROCESS, thereby \
reducing costs. furthermore, the use of BIOCHAR as a SOIL_AMENDMENT can \
be an ATTRACTIVE_OPTION for farmers. the incorporation of BIOCHAR into \
soil has been shown to improve SOIL_FERTILITY, WATER_RETENTION, and \
CROP_PRODUCTIVITY. this can lead to reduced dependence on \
SYNTHETIC_FERTILIZERS and increased AGRICULTURAL_YIELDS. the development \
of a BIOCHAR_ECONOMY has the potential to create NEW_JOB_OPPORTUNITIES \
and increase the NATIONAL_GROSS_DOMESTIC_PRODUCT (gdp). small scale \
enterprises can play a SIGNIFICANT_ROLE in the production and \
distribution of BIOCHAR, providing value added products and helping to \

a FUEL_CELL is an ENERGY_CONVERSION_DEVICE that UTILIZES_HYDROGEN_ENERGY \
through an ELECTROCHEMICAL_REACTION. despite their many advantages, such \
as HIGH_EFFICIENCY, ZERO_EMISSIONS, and FAST_STARTUP, FUEL_CELLS have not \
yet been fully commercialized due to deficiencies in SERVICE_LIFE, cost, \
and performance. EFFICIENT_EVALUATION_METHODS for performance and \
SERVICE_LIFE are critical for the design and optimization of FUEL_CELLS. \
the purpose of this paper was to review the application of \
COMMON_MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS in FUEL_CELLS. the significance and \
status of MACHINE_LEARNING_APPLICATIONS in FUEL_CELLS are briefly \
described. COMMON_MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS, such as \
ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS, SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES, and RANDOM_FORESTS \
are introduced, and their applications in \
FUEL_CELL_PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION and optimization are comprehensively \
elaborated. the review revealed that MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS can be \
successfully used for PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION, SERVICE_LIFE_PREDICTION, \
and FAULT_DIAGNOSIS in FUEL_CELLS, with GOOD_ACCURACY in solving \
NONLINEAR_PROBLEMS. combined with OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS, \
MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS can further carry out the optimization of design \
and operating parameters to achieve MULTIPLE_OPTIMIZATION_GOALS with \
GOOD_ACCURACY and efficiency. it is expected that this REVIEW_PAPER could \

Title: application of MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNOLOGIES in \
BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION_PROCESSA_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
the search for renewable, affordable, sustainable, and ecologically \
benign fuels to substitute fossil based diesel fuels has led to increased \
traction in the search for BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION and utilization in \
RECENT_TIMES. BIODIESEL, a form of LIQUID_BIOFUEL, has been found to \
ALLEVIATE_ENVIRONMENTAL_DEGRADATION, ENHANCE_ENGINE_PERFORMANCE, and \
reduce emissions of TOXIC_GASES in transportation and other \
INTERNAL_COMBUSTION_ENGINES. however, BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION_PROCESSES have \
been dogged with various challenges and complexities which have limited \
its expected progression. the introduction of data based technologies is \
one of the remedies aimed at deescalating the challenges associated with \
BIODIESEL_SYNTHESIS. in this study, the application of MACHINE_LEARNING \
(ml) based technologies including ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann), \
RESPONSE_SURFACE_METHODOLOGY (rsm), \
ADAPTIVE_NETWORK_BASED_FUZZY_INFERENCE_SYSTEM (anfis), etc. as tools for \
the prediction, modeling, and OPTIMIZATION of the \
BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION_PROCESS was interrogated based on the outcomes of \
PREVIOUS_STUDIES in the RESEARCH_DOMAIN. specifically, we review the \
influence of INPUT_VARIABLES like alcohol: OIL_MOLAR_RATIO, \
CATALYST_CONCENTRATION, REACTION_TEMPERATURE, RESIDENCE_TIME, and \
AGITATION_SPEED on the BIODIESEL_YIELD (output variable). the outcome of \
this INVESTIGATION_SHOWS that the usage of ann, rsm, anfis, and other \
MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNOLOGIES raised BIODIESEL_YIELD to between 84% and \
98% while the STATISTICAL_VERIFICATION_SHOWS that the \
PEARSON_CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT and coefficient of determination are \
close to 1. going forward, more targeted and COLLABORATIVE_RESEARCH is \
needed to escalate the use of INNOVATIVE_TECHNOLOGIES for the \
ENTIRE_BIODIESEL_VALUE_CHAIN to ENHANCE_PRODUCTION_EFFICIENCY, ensure \

this ARTICLE_REVIEWS RECENT_STUDIES applying MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) \
approaches to BIOCHAR_APPLICATIONS. we first briefly introduce the \
GENERAL_BIOCHAR_PRODUCTION_PROCESS. VARIOUS_ASPECTS are contained, \
including the BIOCHAR_APPLICATION in the elimination of HEAVY_METALS \

predict the ADSORPTION_EFFECTIVENESS of biochar for water HEAVY_METALS \
with higher accuracy. moreover, the literature proposed a comprehensive \
data driven model to forecast BIOCHAR_YIELD and compositions under \
VARIOUS_BIOMASS_INPUT_FEEDSTOCK and DIFFERENT_PYROLYSIS_CRITERIA. they \
said a 12.7% improvement in PREDICTION_ACCURACY compared to the existing \

Title: a review on the application of MACHINE_LEARNING in production of \
WOODY_BIOMASS from natural and planted forests
Abstract:
```
the forest is considered as a SIGNIFICANT_SOURCE of \
WOODY_BIOMASS_PRODUCTION. SUSTAINABLE_PRODUCTION of WOOD, lower emittance \
of co2 from burning, and lower amount of sulfur and HEAVY_METALS are the \
advantages of woods rather than FOSSIL_FUELS. the utilization of BIOMASS, \
as an ENERGY_RESOURCE, is required four MAIN_STEPS of production, \
pretreatment, bio refinery, and upgrading. this \
WORK_REVIEWS_MACHINE_LEARNING_APPLICATIONS in the production of the \
WOODY_BIOMASS RAW_MATERIAL in forests because investigating numerous \
RELATED_WORKS concluded that there is a considerable reviewing gap in \
analyzing and collecting the applications of MACHINE_LEARNING in the \
WOODY_BIOMASS. to fill this gap in the CURRENT_WORK, the origin of woods \
is explained and the application of MACHINE_LEARNING in this section is \
scrutinized. then, the MULTIDISCIPLINARY_ENHANCEMENT_APPROACHES in the \
production of plants as well as the role of MACHINE_LEARNING in each of \
them are reviewed. meanwhile, the role of natural and planted forests in \
the production of WOODY_BIOMASS is explained and the application of \
MACHINE_LEARNING in these areas is surveyed. summarily, after analysis of \
NUMEROUS_PAPERS, it is concluded that MACHINE_LEARNING and DEEP_LEARNING \
is widely utilized in the production of WOODY_BIOMASS to enhance the \
WOOD_PRODUCTION_QUANTITY and quality, improve the predictions, enhance \
the HARVESTING_TECHNIQUES, and diminish the losses.  2023 author(s).

Title: enhancement of QUALITY and QUANTITY of WOODY_BIOMASS produced in forests \
using MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS
Abstract:
```
FOREST is considered a SIGNIFICANT_SOURCE of WOODY_BIOMASS_PRODUCTION. \
SUSTAINABLE_PRODUCTION of wood, lower emittance of co2 from burning, and \
lower amount of sulfur and HEAVY_METALS are the advantages of wood rather \
than fossil fuels. the QUALITY and QUANTITY of WOODY_BIOMASS_PRODUCTION \
are a function of some operations including GENETIC_MODIFICATIONS, high \
QUALITY FORESTRY, evaluation, monitoring, storage, and transportation. \
due to surveying numerous related works, it was found that there is a \
considerable reviewing gap in analyzing and collecting the applications \
of MACHINE_LEARNING in the QUALITY and QUANTITY of WOODY_BIOMASS. to fill \
this gap in the CURRENT_WORK, the above mentioned operations are \
explained followed by the applications of MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS. \
conclusively, MACHINE_LEARNING and DEEP_LEARNING can be employed in \
estimating MAIN_EFFECTIVE_FACTORS on TREES_GROWTH, CLASSIFICATION of \
seeds, trees, and regions, as well as providing DECISION_MAKING tools for \
farmers or governors, evaluation of BIOMASS, understanding the relation \
between the WOODY_BIMASS INTERNAL_STRUCTURE and bio fuel production, the \
ultimate and PROXIMATE_ANALYSES, prediction of WOOD_CONTENTS and \
dimensions, determination of the proportion of mixed WOODY_MATERIALS, \
monitoring for EARLY_DISEASE_IDENTIFICATION and CLASSIFICATION, \
classifying TREES_DISEASES, estimating evapotranspiration, collecting \
information about FOREST_REGIONS and its QUALITY, NITROGEN_CONCENTRATION \
in trees, choosing VIABLE_STORAGE_SITES for STORAGE_DEPOTS and improving \
the solution, classifying DIFFERENT_FILLING_LEVELS in silage, estimating \
ACETIC_ACID_SYNTHESIS and AEROBIC_REACTIONS in silage, determining \
CROP_QUANTITY in silo, estimating the METHANE_PRODUCTION, and monitoring \
and predicting WATER_CONTENT, QUALITY and QUANTITY of stored BIOMASS, \

Title: a short term SOLAR_IRRADIANCE forecasting modelling approach based on \
three decomposition algorithms and ADAPTIVE_NEURO_FUZZY_INFERENCE_SYSTEM
Abstract:
```
in this study, a case study of four indian cities i.e. ajmer, jaipur, \
jodhpur and kota in the state of rajasthan are considered wherein 30 min \
ahead data have been obtained via the data site of the national institute \
of wind energy and wind resource (niwe) on which a proposed global \
horizontal irradiance (ghi) PREDICTION_TECHNIQUE for all seasons is \
applied. here, data has been pre processed using three different signal \
decomposition algorithms in parallel i.e. empirical mode decomposition \
(emd), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise \
(ceemdan) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (eemd). further, \
based on pearson's correlation coefficient (pcc), corresponding imfs & \
corresponding residual obtained using the three decomposition algorithms \
are compared amongst each other respectively and that corresponding imfs \
& corresponding residual are chosen for SIGNAL_RECONSTRUCTION which are \
having highest correlation coefficient values. thereafter, these selected \
imfs and residual from each algorithm are combined to form single input. \
in this way, three inputs formed from three decomposition algorithms \
based on the pcc values are fed to ADAPTIVE_NEURO_FUZZY_INFERENCE_SYSTEM \
(anfis) for SOLAR_IRRADIANCE forecasting. the proposed TECHNIQUE_SHOWS \
significantly higher ACCURATE_RESULTS with less than 2 % mape for \
different seasons considered at the SITE_LOCATIONS considered. further, \
it terms of performance, the proposed technique is found to be \
independent of SITE_LOCATION.  2023 elsevier ltd
