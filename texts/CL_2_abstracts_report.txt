AB BIODIESEL has the potential to significantly contribute to making
   transportation fuels more sustainable.  due to the complexity and
   nonlinearity of processes for BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION and use, fast and
   accurate MODELING tools are required for their design, optimization,
   monitoring, and CONTROL. data driven MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) techniques have
   demonstrated SUPERIOR_PREDICTIVE_CAPABILITY compared to CONVENTIONAL_METHODS
   for MODELING such highly COMPLEX_PROCESSES. among the
   AVAILABLE_ML_TECHNIQUES, the ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) technology is
   the most widely used approach in BIODIESEL_RESEARCH. the ANN_APPROACH is a
   COMPUTATIONAL_LEARNING_METHOD that mimics the human brain's neurological
   processing ability to map input output relationships of ill defined systems.
   given its HIGH_GENERALIZATION_CAPACITY, ann has gained popularity in dealing
   with complex nonlinear real world engineering and SCIENTIFIC_PROBLEMS. this
   paper is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing
   VARIOUS_ML_TECHNOLOGY_APPLICATIONS, with a PARTICULAR_FOCUS on ann, to solve
   FUNCTION_APPROXIMATION, optimization, monitoring, and CONTROL_PROBLEMS in
   BIODIESEL_RESEARCH. moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using
   ML_TECHNOLOGY in BIODIESEL_RESEARCH are highlighted to
   DIRECT_FUTURE_R&D_EFFORTS in this domain.  ML_TECHNOLOGY has generally been
   used in BIODIESEL_RESEARCH for MODELING (trans)ESTERIFICATION_PROCESSES,
   physico chemical characteristics of BIODIESEL, and BIODIESEL fueled
   INTERNAL_COMBUSTION_ENGINES. the PRIMARY_PURPOSE of introducing
   ML_TECHNOLOGY to the BIODIESEL_INDUSTRY has been to monitor and
   CONTROL_BIODIESEL_SYSTEMS in real time; however, these issues have rarely
   been explored in the literature.  therefore, FUTURE_STUDIES appear to be
   directed towards the use of ML_TECHNIQUES for REAL_TIME_PROCESS_MONITORING
   and CONTROL of BIODIESEL_SYSTEMS to ENHANCE_PRODUCTION_EFFICIENCY,

   NANOFLUID_RESEARCH for forecasting thermophysical features and HEAT_TRANSFER

AB for the last years, the RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT in the field of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY has been growing due to the need of RENEWABLE_ENERGY as an
   extended and RELIABLE_SOURCE of energy.  however, the implementation of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY has many COMPLEX_PROBLEMS not easily solved with
   CONVENTIONAL_METHODS. recently, ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNIQUES such as
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS, FUZZY_LOGIC and GENETIC_ALGORITHMS, have been
   widely used to deal with these problems in the field of RENEWABLE_ENERGY.
   nevertheless, issues with a degree of UNCERTAINTY_NEED_BAYESIAN_NETWORKS
   since this is one of the most EFFECTIVE_THEORIES to face them.  this
   technique can contribute to the RENEWABLE_ENERGY harnessing and other
   OPEN_ISSUES on this field.  in this work we show the state of the art of the
   applications of BAYESIAN_NETWORKS in RENEWABLE_ENERGY, such as
   SOLAR_THERMAL, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal, HYDROELECTRIC_ENERGIES and
   biomass.  additionally, we include related topics such as ENERGY_STORAGE,
   SMART_GRIDS and ENERGY_ASSESSMENT. we classify the literature by areas
   considering three MAIN_SUBJECTS: RESOURCE_EVALUATION, operation, and
   applications, and in each section we describe the POSSIBLE_DIRECTIONS to be
   taken in the research of the field.  we find that the MAIN_APPLICATIONS are
   done for forecasting, FAULT_DIAGNOSIS, maintenance, operation, planning,

SO Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
PY 2022
AB over the past two decades, the use of MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) methods to
   MODEL_BIOMASS and WASTE_GASIFICATION/PYROLYSIS has increased rapidly.  only
   70 papers were published in the 2000s compared to a total of 549
   publications in the 2010s.  however, the approaches and findings have yet to
   be systematically reviewed.  in this work, the MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS most
   commonly employed for modelling GASIFICATION and PYROLYSIS_PROCESSES are
   discussed with reference to their applications, merits, and limitations.
   WHILST_COEFFICIENTS of determination (r2) can be difficult to compare
   directly, due to some studies having greatly DIFFERENT_APPROACHES and aims,
   most studies consistently achieved a HIGH_PREDICTION_ACCURACY with r2 >
   0.90. ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS have been most widely used due to their
   potential to learn highly NON_LINEAR input output relationships.  however, a
   variety of methods (e.g.  REGRESSION_METHODS, tree based methods, and
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES) are appropriate depending on the application,
   DATA_AVAILABILITY, MODEL_SPEED, etc.  it is concluded that ml has
   GREAT_POTENTIAL for the development of models with greater accuracy.  some
   advantages of MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS over existing models are their ability
   to incorporate relevant non numerical parameters and the power to generate a
   multitude of solutions for a WIDE_RANGE of INPUT_PARAMETERS. more emphasis
   should be placed on MODEL_INTERPRETABILITY in order to better understand the

   limited due to challenges related to FEEDSTOCK_VARIABILITY,
   CONVERSION_ECONOMICS, and SUPPLY_CHAIN_RELIABILITY. ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
   (ai), an emerging concept, has been applied to BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS in
   RECENT_DECADES to address those challenges.  this paper reviewed 164
   articles published between 2005 and 2019 that applied
   DIFFERENT_AI_TECHNIQUES to BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS. this REVIEW_FOCUSES on
   identifying the UNIQUE_CAPABILITIES of VARIOUS_AI_TECHNIQUES in addressing
   BIOENERGY related research challenges and improving the performance of
   BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS. specifically, we characterized AI_STUDIES by their
   INPUT_VARIABLES, OUTPUT_VARIABLES, AI_TECHNIQUES, DATASET_SIZE, and
   performance.  we examined AI_APPLICATIONS throughout the LIFE_CYCLE of
   BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS. we identified four areas in which ai has been mostly
   applied, including (1) the prediction of BIOMASS_PROPERTIES, (2) the
   prediction of PROCESS_PERFORMANCE of BIOMASS_CONVERSION, including
   DIFFERENT_CONVERSION_PATHWAYS and technologies, (3) the prediction of
   BIOFUEL_PROPERTIES and the performance of BIOENERGY end use systems, and (4)
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODELING and optimization.  based on the review, ai is
   particularly useful in generating data that are hard to be measured
   directly, improving TRADITIONAL_MODELS of BIOMASS_CONVERSION and BIOFUEL end
   uses, and overcoming the challenges of TRADITIONAL_COMPUTING techniques for
   BIOENERGY SUPPLY_CHAIN design and optimization.  for FUTURE_RESEARCH,
   efforts are needed to develop standardized and PRACTICAL_PROCEDURES for
   selecting AI_TECHNIQUES and determining TRAINING_DATA_SAMPLES, to
   ENHANCE_DATA_COLLECTION, documentation, and sharing across BIOENERGY related
   areas, and to explore the potential of ai in supporting the
   SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of BIOENERGY_SYSTEMS from HOLISTIC_PERSPECTIVES.

AB conventional and HYDROTHERMAL_GASIFICATION are
   PROMISING_THERMOCHEMICAL_TECHNOLOGIES for the production of syngas from
   WASTE_BIOMASS. both GASIFICATION_PROCESSES are complex, with several
   INTERMEDIATE_REACTIONS occurring simultaneously and at DIFFERENT_TIMES.
   therefore, traditional modeling approaches, including thermodynamic and
   KINETIC_MODELS, process modeling and COMPUTATION_FLUID_DYNAMICS (cfd), are
   sometimes used to describe the process and study the influence of
   PROCESS_PARAMETERS on SYNGAS_YIELD. however, most TRADITIONAL_MODELS are
   impractical and often challenging to model the input output relationship.
   MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) methods provide a PROMISING_ALTERNATIVE to traditional
   modeling approaches.  this study outlined the advancement in the application
   of ml to GASIFICATION_RESEARCH. DIFFERENT_ML_ALGORITHMS, including
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS, DEEP_LEARNING and SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES, are
   briefly described.  challenges and limitations of ml based methods for
   GASIFICATION_RESEARCH are also discussed.  when implemented effectively, ml

PY 2014
AB bioenergy is a new source of energy that accounts for a SUBSTANTIAL_PORTION
   of the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION in many countries.  the production of
   bioenergy is expected to increase due to its UNIQUE_ADVANTAGES, such as no
   harmful emissions and abundance.  supply related problems are the main
   obstacles precluding the increase of use of biomass (which is bulky and has
   low energy density) to produce bioenergy.  to overcome this challenge, large
   scale optimization models are needed to be solved to enable decision makers
   to plan, design, and manage bioenergy SUPPLY_CHAINS. therefore, the use of
   effective optimization approaches is of great importance.  the
   TRADITIONAL_MATHEMATICAL_METHODS (such as linear, integer, and mixed integer
   programming) frequently fail to find optimal solutions for non convex and/or
   large scale models whereas metaheuristics are efficient approaches for
   finding near optimal solutions that use less computational resources.  this
   paper presents a comprehensive review by studying and analyzing the
   application of metaheuristics to solve bioenergy SUPPLY_CHAIN models as well
   as the exclusive challenges of the mathematical problems applied in the
   bioenergy SUPPLY_CHAIN field.  the reviewed metaheuristics include: (1)
   POPULATION_APPROACHES, such as ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION (aco), the genetic
   algorithm (ga), particle swarm optimization (pso), and bee colony algorithm
   (bca); and (2) TRAJECTORY_APPROACHES, such as the TABU_SEARCH (ts) and
   SIMULATED_ANNEALING (sa). based on the outcomes of this literature review,
   the integrated design and planning of bioenergy SUPPLY_CHAINS problem has
   been solved primarily by implementing the ga.  the
   PRODUCTION_PROCESS_OPTIMIZATION was addressed primarily by using both the ga
   and pso.  the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK_DESIGN_PROBLEM was treated by utilizing
   the ga and aco.  the truck and TASK_SCHEDULING_PROBLEM was solved using the
   sa and the ts, where the trajectory based methods proved to outperform the
   population based methods.  2014 by the authors; licensee mdpi, basel,

PY 2022
AB ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE, an emerging technology, widely exists in the field
   of ENGINEERING_SCIENCE and technology.  due to its HIGH_EFFICIENCY and
   precision, ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE is increasingly used in the
   OPTIMAL_CONTROL of WATER_TREATMENT and SEAWATER_DESALINATION. generally, the
   design of a DESALINATION_SYSTEM includes four processes: SITE_SELECTION,
   ENERGY_PREDICTION, DESALINATION_TECHNOLOGY_SELECTION and
   SYSTEMATIC_PARAMETER_OPTIMIZATION. to a LARGE_EXTENT, these choices depend
   on the experience and RELEVANT_CRITERIA of researchers and experts.
   however, facing the scientific and TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and growing
   expectations, it is impossible to solve SUCH_COMPLEX_NONLINEAR_PROBLEMS by
   SIMPLE_EXPERIENCE and MATHEMATICAL_MODELS, but ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE is
   good at this.  in this paper, we synthetically analyzed and summarized the
   application of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE in the field of SEAWATER_DESALINATION
   with RENEWABLE_ENERGY. ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_APPLICATION in DESALINATION
   is mainly divided into four aspects: expert DECISION_MAKING, optimization,
   PREDICTION_AND_CONTROL by sequence.  the features of ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
   employed in the design of DESALINATION_SYSTEMS not only realize the maximum
   of efficiency and minimum of cost, but release the HUMAN_RESOURCES. after
   analyzing the four processes of DESALINATION, it is found that
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK and GENETIC_ALGORITHM are more widespread and
   mature than other ALGORITHMS in dealing with multi objective
   NONLINEAR_PROBLEMS. this paper overviewed the application of
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNOLOGIES in DECISION_MAKING, optimization,
   PREDICTION_AND_CONTROL throughout the four processes of

   present review, a COMPREHENSIVE_LITERATURE_SUMMARIZATION and analysis on the
   application of AI_TECHNIQUES to tes is presented.  performance prediction,
   OPTIMAL_DESIGN, control and operation by means of ai for the TES_SYSTEMS
   with VARIOUS_APPLICATIONS are discussed and compared.  this review shows
   that ai based prediction models, like ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK and
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE, can accurately estimate the TES_PERFORMANCE and the
   properties of TES_MATERIALS in a very fast fashion.  ai based
   OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS, such as GENETIC_ALGORITHM,
   PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION, and teaching learning based optimization are
   able to optimize the design and operation of the TES_SYSTEMS towards the
   objectives like higher SYSTEM_EFFICIENCY, COST_SAVINGS, more renewable
   ENERGY_UTILIZATION and less ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS. FUZZY_LOGIC can be
   utilized to properly DESIGN_AND_CONTROL the TES_SYSTEMS where uncertain and
   IMPRECISE_FACTORS are inevitably present.  GENERAL_STRATEGIES of the ai

AB the consumption of FOSSIL_FUELS has exponentially increased in
   RECENT_DECADES, despite SIGNIFICANT_AIR_POLLUTION,
   ENVIRONMENTAL_DETERIORATION challenges, HEALTH_PROBLEMS, and limited
   resources.  biofuel can be used instead of FOSSIL_FUEL due to
   ENVIRONMENTAL_BENEFITS and availability to produce VARIOUS_ENERGY_SORTS like
   electricity, power, and heating or to SUSTAIN_TRANSPORTATION fuels.
   BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION is an INTRICATE_PROCESS that requires identifying
   UNKNOWN_NONLINEAR_RELATIONSHIPS between the SYSTEM_INPUT and OUTPUT_DATA;
   therefore, accurate and swift modeling instruments like MACHINE_LEARNING
   (ml) or ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) are necessary to design, handle,
   control, optimize, and monitor the system.  among the BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION
   modeling methods, MACHINE_LEARNING provides better predictions with the
   highest accuracy, inspired by the brain's autolearning and self improving
   capability to solve the study's complicated questions; therefore, it is
   beneficial for modeling (trans) ESTERIFICATION_PROCESSES,
   PHYSICOCHEMICAL_PROPERTIES, and MONITORING BIODIESEL_SYSTEMS in real time.
   MACHINE_LEARNING_APPLICATIONS in the PRODUCTION_PHASE include
   QUALITY_OPTIMIZATION and estimation, PROCESS_CONDITIONS, and quantity.
   EMISSIONS_COMPOSITION and TEMPERATURE_ESTIMATION and
   MOTOR_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS investigate in the CONSUMPTION_PHASE.
   FATTY_METHYL_ACID_ESTER_STANDS as the OUTPUT_PARAMETER, and the
   INPUT_PARAMETERS include oil and CATALYST_TYPE, methanol to oil ratio,
   CATALYST_CONCENTRATION, REACTION_TIME, domain, and frequency.  this paper
   will present a review and discuss VARIOUS_ML_TECHNOLOGY_ADVANTAGES,

AB in this study, the growing SCIENTIFIC_FIELD of ALTERNATIVE_BIOFUELS was
   examined, with respect to hydrochars produced from RENEWABLE_BIOMASSES.
   hydrochars are the SOLID_PRODUCTS of HYDROTHERMAL_CARBONIZATION (htc) and
   their properties depend on the INITIAL_BIOMASS and the temperature and
   duration of treatment.  the basic (scopus) and advanced (CITESPACE) analysis
   of literature showed that this is a DYNAMIC_RESEARCH_AREA, with several sub
   fields of INTENSE_ACTIVITY. the focus of researchers on SEWAGE_SLUDGE and
   FOOD_WASTE as HYDROCHAR_PRECURSORS was highlighted and reviewed.  it was
   established that hydrochars have improved behavior as fuels compared to
   these FEEDSTOCKS. FOOD_WASTE can be particularly useful in co
   HYDROTHERMAL_CARBONIZATION with ash rich materials.  in the case of
   SEWAGE_SLUDGE, SIMULTANEOUS_P_RECOVERY from the HTC_WASTEWATER may add more
   value to the process.  for both FEEDSTOCKS, results from large scale htc are
   practically non existent.  following the review, related data from the years
   2014 2020 were retrieved and fitted into four
   DIFFERENT_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns). based on the ELEMENTAL_CONTENT,
   HTC_TEMPERATURE and time (as inputs), the higher heating values (hhvs) and
   yields (as outputs) could be successfully predicted, regardless of
   ORIGINAL_BIOMASS used for HYDROCHAR_PRODUCTION. ann3 (based on c, o,
   H_CONTENT, and HTC_TEMPERATURE) showed the OPTIMUM_HHV predicting
   performance (r2 0.917, root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR 1.124), however, hydrochars'
   hhvs could also be satisfactorily predicted by the C_CONTENT alone (ann1, r2
   0.897, root MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR 1.289).  2020 by the authors.

   the pollution associated, URGENT_MEASURES are required to
   ENSURE_ENERGY_MAXIMIZATION, while reducing the extended
   EXPERIMENTAL_TIME_CYCLE involved in ENERGY_PRODUCTION. in lieu of this, the
   prominence of catalysts in CHEMICAL_REACTIONS, particularly energy related
   reactions cannot be undermined, and thus it is critical to discover and
   DESIGN_CATALYST, towards the optimization of CHEMICAL_PROCESSES and
   generation of SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY. most recently, ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
   (ai) has been incorporated into several fields, particularly in advancing
   CATALYTIC_PROCESSES. the integration of INTENSIVE_DATA set,
   MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS and robotics, provides a very POWERFUL_TOOL in

   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS (anns)RESPONSE_SURFACE_METHODOLOGY (rsm)
   algorithm.  febased and nibased nps and IONS, including mg2+, cu2+, na+,
   nh4+, and k+, behave differently towards the response of HYDROGEN_YIELD (hy)
   and HYDROGEN_EVOLUTION_RATE (her). manipulating the size and concentration
   of nps was found to be effective in enhancing the hy for febased nps and
   IONS, but not for nibased nps and IONS. an OPTIMAL_RANGE of PARTICLE_SIZE
   (86120 nm) and niion/np concentration (81120 mg l1) existed for her.
   meanwhile, the manipulation of the size and concentration of nps was found
   to be ineffective for both iron and nickel for the improvement of her.  in
   fact, the variation in size of nps for the enhancement of hy and her
   demonstrated an APPRECIABLE_DIFFERENCE. the smaller (less than 42 nm) nps
   were found to definitely improve the hy, whereas for the her, the relatively
   bigger size of nps (4050 nm) seemed to significantly increase the h2
   evolution rate.  it was also found that the variations in the concentration
   of the investigated IONS only statistically influenced the her, not the hy.
   the level of response (the enhanced her) towards inputs was underpinned and
   the order of significance towards her was identified as the following: na+ >
   mg2+ > cu2+ > nh4+ > k+.  2021 by the authors.  LICENSEE_MDPI, basel,

   operation across the world, with the number of running hours steadily
   rising, either as stand alone units or as part of integrated
   GAS_TURBINEELECTRIC_ENERGY_PLANTS. fcs are a POTENTIAL_ENERGY_SOURCE with
   GREAT_EFFICIENCY and ZERO_EMISSIONS. to ensure the best performance, they
   normally function within a confined temperature and HUMIDITY_RANGE;
   nevertheless, this makes the system difficult to regulate, resulting in
   defects and hastened deterioration.  for diagnosis, there are two
   PRIMARY_APPROACHES: restricted INPUT_INFORMATION, which gives an
   unobtrusive, rapid yet restricted examination, and advanced
   characterization, which provides a more ACCURATE_DIAGNOSIS but frequently

   with QUICK_DATA collecting.  this WORK_FOCUSES on SOFTWARE_MODELS that allow

AB ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann) techniques are becoming useful in the
   CURRENT_ERA due to the VAST_DEVELOPMENT of the
   CURRENT_COMPUTER_TECHNOLOGIES. ann has been used in VARIOUS_FIELDS
   especially in the field of science and technology.  one of the advantage
   that makes ann so interesting is the ANNS_ABILITY to learn the input and
   OUTPUT_RELATIONSHIP even though the relationship is non linear.  in
   addition, ann is also useful for modelling, optimization, prediction,
   forecasting, and controlling systems.  the MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this paper is
   to present a review of the ANN_TECHNIQUES for sizing a stand alone
   photovoltaic (pv) system.  the review in this PAPER_SHOWS the potential of
   ann as a DESIGN_TOOL for a stand alone pv.  in addition, ann is very useful
   to improve the sizing process of the STAND_ALONE_PV_SYSTEM. the sizing
   process is of PARAMOUNT_IMPORTANCE to a STAND_ALONE_PV_SYSTEM in order to
   make sure the system can generate AMPLE_ELECTRICAL_ENERGY to supply the

   SIGNIFICANT_STEP in meeting CARBON_REDUCTION_TARGETS, which can produce a
   variety of appealing outcomes that are useful to HUMANITYS_EVOLUTION. many
   countries have adopted NATIONAL_POLICIES to decrease pollution by reducing
   FOSSIL_FUEL_USE and increasing RENEWABLE_ENERGY_USAGE by alleviating climate
   change (wind and solar, etc.). the ever growing need for RENEWABLE_SOURCES
   has led to economic and TECHNOLOGICAL_PROBLEMS, such as WIND_ENERGY,
   essential for EFFECTIVE_GRID_CONTROL, and the design of a WIND_PROJECT.

   three different WORKING_FLUIDS (PURE_WATER, al2o3/water NANOFLUID and
   cuo/water NANOFLUID) is simulated using ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann). the
   SOLAR_RADIATION_HEAT_FLUX varied between 650 and 950 w/m2 and the FLOW_RATE
   varied from 1 to 4 l/min.  the effect of RADIATION_HEAT_FLUX,
   MASS_FLOW_RATE, ambient and INLET_TEMPERATURE on the THERMAL_EFFICIENCY was
   analysed.  the predicted results of the three above mentioned WORKING_FLUIDS
   are compared and validated with those of the measurements.  the output of
   ann for all three WORKING_FLUIDS was found to be reasonably capable of
   estimating the performance of the FLAT_PLATE_COLLECTOR_SYSTEM with the
   deviation less than 2%, while the trend of each working fluid is different
   against the MASS_FLOW_RATE. EXPERIMENTAL_INVESTIGATIONS are usually time
   consuming and their equipment is expensive.  therefore, the advantages of
   the ANN_MODEL compared to the CONVENTIONAL_TESTING methods are speed,

AB the increased WATER_SCARCITY, DEPLETION of FRESHWATER_RESOURCES, and rising
   ENVIRONMENTAL_AWARENESS are stressing for the development of
   SUSTAINABLE_WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_PROCESSES. MICROALGAE based
   WASTEWATER_TREATMENT has resulted in a PARADIGM_SHIFT in our approach toward
   NUTRIENT_REMOVAL and SIMULTANEOUS_RESOURCE_RECOVERY from WASTEWATER.
   WASTEWATER_TREATMENT and the generation of BIOFUELS and bioproducts from
   MICROALGAE can be coupled to promote the CIRCULAR_ECONOMY synergistically.
   a MICROALGAL_BIOREFINERY_TRANSFORMS_MICROALGAL_BIOMASS into BIOFUELS,
   BIOACTIVE_CHEMICALS, and biomaterials.  the large scale cultivation of
   MICROALGAE is essential for the commercialization and industrialization of
   MICROALGAE_BIOREFINERY. however, the INHERENT_COMPLEXITY of
   MICROALGAL_CULTIVATION_PARAMETERS regarding physiological and
   ILLUMINATION_PARAMETERS_RENDERS it challenging to facilitate a smooth and
   cost effective operation.  ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai)/MACHINE_LEARNING
   algorithms (mla) offer INNOVATIVE_STRATEGIES for assessing, predicting, and
   regulating uncertainties in ALGAL_WASTEWATER_TREATMENT and BIOREFINERY. the
   CURRENT_STUDY presents a CRITICAL_REVIEW of the most promising ai/mlas that
   demonstrate a potential to be applied in MICROALGAL_TECHNOLOGIES. the most
   commonly used mlas include ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS,
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINE, GENETIC_ALGORITHMS, DECISION_TREE, and
   RANDOM_FOREST_ALGORITHMS. RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS in ai have made it possible to
   combine cutting edge techniques from AI_RESEARCH_FIELDS with MICROALGAE for
   ACCURATE_ANALYSIS of LARGE_DATASETS. mlas have been extensively studied for
   their potential in MICROALGAE_DETECTION and CLASSIFICATION. however, the
   ML_APPLICATION in MICROALGAL_INDUSTRIES, such as optimizing
   MICROALGAE_CULTIVATION for increased BIOMASS_PRODUCTIVITY, is still in its
   infancy.  incorporating smart ai/ml enabled INTERNET_OF_THINGS (iot) based
   technologies can help the MICROALGAL_INDUSTRIES to operate effectively with
   MINIMUM_RESOURCES. FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS are also highlighted, and some
   of the challenges and perspectives of ai/ml are outlined.  as the world is

AB BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION and VALORIZATION for

   WASTE_GENERATION by applying the FUNDAMENTAL_RECOVERY_CONCEPT through
   biowaste to BIOENERGY conversion systems   an APPROPRIATE_APPROACH in a
   CIRCULAR_BIOECONOMY. BIOMASS_WASTE (biowaste) is discarded ORGANIC_MATERIALS
   made of BIOMASS (e.g., AGRICULTURE_WASTE and ALGAL_RESIDUE). biowaste is
   widely studied as one of the POTENTIAL_FEEDSTOCKS in the
   BIOWASTE_VALORIZATION_PROCESS due to its being abundantly available.  in
   terms of PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATIONS, FEEDSTOCK_VARIABILITY from biowaste,
   CONVERSION_COSTS and supply CHAIN_STABILITY prevent the WIDESPREAD_USAGE of
   BIOENERGY_PRODUCTS. BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION and VALORIZATION have used
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai), a newly developed idea, to overcome these
   difficulties.  this report analyzed 118 works that applied
   VARIOUS_AI_ALGORITHMS to BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION and VALORIZATION related
   research published between 2007 and 2022. four COMMON_AI_TYPES are utilized
   in BIOWASTE_REMEDIATION and VALORIZATION: NEURAL_NETWORKS,
   BAYESIAN_NETWORKS, DECISION_TREE, and MULTIVARIATE_REGRESSION. the
   NEURAL_NETWORK is the most FREQUENT_AI for PREDICTION_MODELS, the
   BAYESIAN_NETWORK is utilized for PROBABILISTIC_GRAPHICAL_MODELS, and the
   DECISION_TREE is trusted for providing tools to assist DECISION_MAKING.
   meanwhile, MULTIVARIATE_REGRESSION is employed to identify the relationship
   between EXPERIMENTAL_VARIABLES. ai is a remarkably EFFECTIVE_TOOL in
   predicting data, which is reportedly better than the CONVENTIONAL_APPROACH
   owing to its characteristics of time saving and HIGH_ACCURACY. the challenge

AB ENERGY_POVERTY (ep) is a WIDESPREAD_PROBLEM in europe.  EP_DETECTION is
   hampered by a lack of data and GLOBAL_METRICS. recently,
   INNOVATIVE_APPROACHES using ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENT (ai) techniques have been
   increasingly applied for the EP_ALLEVIATION. in this work, studies focused
   on the application of ai on ep were studied.  it was identified that there
   is not a HIGH_NUMBER of works that apply ai to fight against ep (considering
   this problem as a MULTIDIMENSIONAL_PHENOMENON). ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL networks
   based algorithms and DECISION_TREES were the most used algorithms in the
   reviewed literature focused on EP_ALLEVIATION. however, several
   AI_APPLICATIONS focused on PARTIAL_ASPECTS of the ep or on areas intimately
   related to ep (low income, high ENERGY_PRICE and low ENERGY_EFFICIENCY of
   buildings) that allow the characterization of the problem in an
   EFFICIENT_WAY have been published in RECENT_YEARS; the last 7 years
   published literature have been reviewed in this work.  it was found that
   NEURAL_NETWORKS_ALGORITHMS were the most used models for low income,
   ENERGY_PRICE and POOR_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_CHARACTERIZATIONS.
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES based algorithms were the most POPULAR_AI_METHOD
   applied on ENERGY_CONSUMPTION related problems.  DEEP_LEARNING was the most

AB BIOCHAR has gained attention as an ALTERNATIVE_SOURCE of SOLID_ENERGY and
   for the PROPER_DISPOSAL of AGRICULTURAL_BIOMASS_WASTE (abw). microwave
   assisted pyrolysis (map) is a PROMISING_APPROACH for the production of
   BIOCHAR. this REVIEW_ARTICLE presents the BENEFICIAL_USE of BIOCHAR for
   SOIL_FERTILIZATION, MACHINE_LEARNING (ml), the CIRCULAR_BIOECONOMY, and the
   TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_LEVEL. the use of MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES helps to
   design, predict, and optimize the process.  it can also improve the accuracy
   and efficacy of the BIOCHAR_PRODUCTION_PROCESS, thereby reducing costs.
   furthermore, the use of BIOCHAR as a SOIL_AMENDMENT can be an
   ATTRACTIVE_OPTION for farmers.  the incorporation of BIOCHAR into soil has
   been shown to improve SOIL_FERTILITY, WATER_RETENTION, and
   CROP_PRODUCTIVITY. this can lead to reduced dependence on
   SYNTHETIC_FERTILIZERS and increased AGRICULTURAL_YIELDS. the development of
   a BIOCHAR_ECONOMY has the potential to create NEW_JOB_OPPORTUNITIES and
   increase the NATIONAL_GROSS_DOMESTIC_PRODUCT (gdp). small scale enterprises
   can play a SIGNIFICANT_ROLE in the production and distribution of BIOCHAR,
   providing value added products and helping to promote
   SUSTAINABLE_AGRICULTURE.  2023 by the authors.

AB a FUEL_CELL is an ENERGY_CONVERSION_DEVICE that UTILIZES_HYDROGEN_ENERGY
   through an ELECTROCHEMICAL_REACTION. despite their many advantages, such as
   HIGH_EFFICIENCY, ZERO_EMISSIONS, and FAST_STARTUP, FUEL_CELLS have not yet
   been fully commercialized due to deficiencies in SERVICE_LIFE, cost, and
   performance.  EFFICIENT_EVALUATION_METHODS for performance and SERVICE_LIFE
   are critical for the design and optimization of FUEL_CELLS. the purpose of
   this paper was to review the application of
   COMMON_MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS in FUEL_CELLS. the significance and
   status of MACHINE_LEARNING_APPLICATIONS in FUEL_CELLS are briefly described.
   COMMON_MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS, such as ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS,
   SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES, and RANDOM_FORESTS are introduced, and their
   applications in FUEL_CELL_PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION and optimization are
   comprehensively elaborated.  the review revealed that
   MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS can be successfully used for
   PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION, SERVICE_LIFE_PREDICTION, and FAULT_DIAGNOSIS in
   FUEL_CELLS, with GOOD_ACCURACY in solving NONLINEAR_PROBLEMS. combined with
   OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS, MACHINE_LEARNING_MODELS can further carry out the
   optimization of design and operating parameters to achieve
   MULTIPLE_OPTIMIZATION_GOALS with GOOD_ACCURACY and efficiency.  it is

PY 2023
AB the search for renewable, affordable, sustainable, and ecologically benign
   fuels to substitute fossil based diesel fuels has led to increased traction
   in the search for BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION and utilization in RECENT_TIMES.
   BIODIESEL, a form of LIQUID_BIOFUEL, has been found to
   ALLEVIATE_ENVIRONMENTAL_DEGRADATION, ENHANCE_ENGINE_PERFORMANCE, and reduce
   emissions of TOXIC_GASES in transportation and other
   INTERNAL_COMBUSTION_ENGINES. however, BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION_PROCESSES have
   been dogged with various challenges and complexities which have limited its
   expected progression.  the introduction of data based technologies is one of
   the remedies aimed at deescalating the challenges associated with
   BIODIESEL_SYNTHESIS. in this study, the application of MACHINE_LEARNING (ml)
   based technologies including ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK (ann),
   RESPONSE_SURFACE_METHODOLOGY (rsm),
   ADAPTIVE_NETWORK_BASED_FUZZY_INFERENCE_SYSTEM (anfis), etc.  as tools for
   the prediction, modeling, and OPTIMIZATION of the
   BIODIESEL_PRODUCTION_PROCESS was interrogated based on the outcomes of
   PREVIOUS_STUDIES in the RESEARCH_DOMAIN. specifically, we review the
   influence of INPUT_VARIABLES like alcohol: OIL_MOLAR_RATIO,
   CATALYST_CONCENTRATION, REACTION_TEMPERATURE, RESIDENCE_TIME, and
   AGITATION_SPEED on the BIODIESEL_YIELD (output variable). the outcome of
   this INVESTIGATION_SHOWS that the usage of ann, rsm, anfis, and other
   MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNOLOGIES raised BIODIESEL_YIELD to between 84% and 98%
   while the STATISTICAL_VERIFICATION_SHOWS that the
   PEARSON_CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT and coefficient of determination are close
   to 1. going forward, more targeted and COLLABORATIVE_RESEARCH is needed to

AB this ARTICLE_REVIEWS RECENT_STUDIES applying MACHINE_LEARNING (ml)

   the BIOCHAR_APPLICATION in the elimination of HEAVY_METALS and/or organic
   compounds and the BIOCHAR_APPLICATION in environmental and ECONOMIC_SCOPES,
   for instance, FOOD_SECURITY, energy, and CARBON_EMISSION. the utilization of
   ML_METHODS, including ann, rf, and nn, plays a VITAL_ROLE in evaluating and
   predicting the efficiency of BIOCHAR_ABSORPTION. it has been proved that
   ML_METHODS can validly predict the ADSORPTION_EFFECTIVENESS of biochar for

   a comprehensive data driven model to forecast BIOCHAR_YIELD and compositions
   under VARIOUS_BIOMASS_INPUT_FEEDSTOCK and DIFFERENT_PYROLYSIS_CRITERIA. they
   said a 12.7% improvement in PREDICTION_ACCURACY compared to the existing
   literature.  however, it might need further optimization in this direction.
   in summary, this REVIEW_CONCLUDES increasing studies that a well trained
   ML_METHOD can sufficiently reduce the number of EXPERIMENT_TRIALS and
   working times associated with higher PREDICTION_ACCURACY. moreover, further
   studies on ML_APPLICATIONS are needed to optimize the trade off between

AB BIOFUELS have been widely recognized as POTENTIAL_SOLUTIONS to addressing
   the CLIMATE_CRISIS and STRENGTHENING_ENERGY_SECURITY and sustainability.
   however, techno economic and environmental challenges for the production of
   BIOFUELS remain and complicated CONVERSION_PROCESSES and factors, such as
   materials and PROCESS_DESIGN, need to be taken into consideration for
   solving the challenges, which is not easy.  MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) has been
   combined with the theories of THERMOCHEMICAL_BIOFUEL_CONVERSION_PROCESSES to
   achieve accurate and EFFICIENT_BIOFUEL_PROCESS modelling.  in this review,
   existing ML_APPLICATIONS to predict BIOFUEL_YIELD and composition are
   critically reviewed.  the details of the input and OUTPUT_VARIABLES of the
   developed models for THERMOCHEMICAL_BIOFUEL_CONVERSION_PROCESSES were
   summarized, and their DEVELOPMENT_PROCEDURES were compared.
   TECHNO_ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS results incorporating ML_APPLICATIONS in BIOFUELS
   were also reviewed.  although developed models in literature showed
   GOOD_PERFORMANCE for their targets, respectively, they can hardly be applied
   to other feedstocks or operating conditions.  to overcome the challenge and
   develop UNIVERSAL_MODEL, PERSPECTIVE_APPROACHES were suggested in this
   study.  it was suggested that it is essential to develop SYSTEMATIC_DATASETS
   to support more COMPREHENSIVE_MACHINE learning based modelling towards
   PRACTICAL_APPLICATIONS. potential PROSPECTIVE_RESEARCH and
   DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTIONS on MACHINE_LEARNING based
   THERMOCHEMICAL_BIOFUEL_CONVERSION_PROCESS modeling were recommended, so that
   it can assist in the commercialization and optimization of
   VARIOUS_BIOFUEL_CONVERSIONS leading to a sustainable and CIRCULAR_SOCIETY.

AB FOREST is considered a SIGNIFICANT_SOURCE of WOODY_BIOMASS_PRODUCTION.
   SUSTAINABLE_PRODUCTION of wood, lower emittance of co2 from burning, and
   lower amount of sulfur and HEAVY_METALS are the advantages of wood rather
   than fossil fuels.  the QUALITY and QUANTITY of WOODY_BIOMASS_PRODUCTION are
   a function of some operations including GENETIC_MODIFICATIONS, high QUALITY
   FORESTRY, evaluation, monitoring, storage, and transportation.  due to
   surveying numerous related works, it was found that there is a considerable
   reviewing gap in analyzing and collecting the applications of
   MACHINE_LEARNING in the QUALITY and QUANTITY of WOODY_BIOMASS. to fill this
   gap in the CURRENT_WORK, the above mentioned operations are explained
   followed by the applications of MACHINE_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS. conclusively,
   MACHINE_LEARNING and DEEP_LEARNING can be employed in estimating

AB in this study, a case study of four indian cities i.e.  ajmer, jaipur,
   jodhpur and kota in the state of rajasthan are considered wherein 30 min
   ahead data have been obtained via the data site of the national institute of
   wind energy and wind resource (niwe) on which a proposed global horizontal
   irradiance (ghi) PREDICTION_TECHNIQUE for all seasons is applied.  here,
   data has been pre processed using three different signal decomposition
   algorithms in parallel i.e.  empirical mode decomposition (emd), complete
   ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ceemdan) and
   ensemble empirical mode decomposition (eemd). further, based on pearson's
   correlation coefficient (pcc), corresponding imfs & corresponding residual
   obtained using the three decomposition algorithms are compared amongst each
   other respectively and that corresponding imfs & corresponding residual are
   chosen for SIGNAL_RECONSTRUCTION which are having highest correlation
   coefficient values.  thereafter, these selected imfs and residual from each
   algorithm are combined to form single input.  in this way, three inputs
   formed from three decomposition algorithms based on the pcc values are fed
   to ADAPTIVE_NEURO_FUZZY_INFERENCE_SYSTEM (anfis) for SOLAR_IRRADIANCE
   forecasting.  the proposed TECHNIQUE_SHOWS significantly higher
   ACCURATE_RESULTS with less than 2 % mape for different seasons considered at
   the SITE_LOCATIONS considered.  further, it terms of performance, the
   proposed technique is found to be independent of SITE_LOCATION.  2023
